  abstract = {Freshwater systems are some of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Factors contributing to their degradation can be associated with the expansion and intensification of agriculture in the 20th century, which has led to habitat degradation and water pollution. To mitigate the impacts of agricultural activities and improve stream ecosystem quality, government-funded conservation programs have promoted the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) during the last three to four decades. However, these conservation programs have been implemented within agricultural landscapes without evaluating exhaustively their potential side effects on freshwater species at the watershed scale. This study aimed to assess the changes in freshwater biodiversity in terms of fish species richness under future climate and potential conservation land-management schemes in the Kaskaskia River Watershed, Illinois, USA. Fish regression models were integrated to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the responses of total- and game-fish species richness to four major management practices (crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, modified fertilizer application) identified as the most feasible in terms of stakeholder acceptability and environmental soundness, under 32 distinct climate projections. Results showed that fish species in the KRW are more sensitive to changes in the climate regime than to changes in the land-management practices. Specifically, the most likely percentage changes in fish species revealed a potential decline in richness in all stream orders over time with the worst impacts in the first and second order streams (-5\%---10\% decade 1) due to the progressive increase in the temperatures (0.61 {\textopenbullet}C --0.92 {\textopenbullet}C decade 1) expected in the watershed. The long-term impacts on fish species richness may be inevitable if the proposed land-management alternatives were not accompanied by additional measures specifically design to protect aquatic life.},

  abstract = {The term ``environmental flows'' describes the quantities, quality, and patterns of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. Environmental flows may be achieved in a number of different ways, most of which are based on either (1) limiting alterations from the natural flow baseline to maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity or (2) designing flow regimes to achieve specific ecological and ecosystem service outcomes. We argue that the former practice is more applicable to natural and semi-natural rivers where the primary objective and opportunity is ecological conservation. The latter ``designer'' approach is better suited to modified and managed rivers where return to natural conditions is no longer feasible and the objective is to maximize natural capital as well as support economic growth, recreation, or cultural history. This permits elements of ecosystem design and adaptation to environmental change. In a future characterized by altered climates and intensive regulation, where hybrid and novel aquatic ecosystems predominate, the designer approach may be the only feasible option. This conclusion stems from a lack of natural ecosystems from which to draw analogs and the need to support broader socioeconomic benefits and valuable configurations of natural and social capital.},

The Ecuadorian law requires that the environmental flow remains 10\% of mean annual flow in old hydroelectric stations, however advances on this area suggest this is not adequate. The objective of this research was to assess the impacts of a 10\% release and establish environmental flow recommendations in the Macha{\textasciiacute} ngara and Chulco rivers which have been dammed by the Chanlud and El Labrado hydroelectric plants, in the watershed of the Macha{\textasciiacute} ngara River (southern Ecuador). During twelve months physical and chemical parameters, and aquatic macro-invertebrates were recorded. The analysis found significant differences in some parameters, indicating a decline in ecosystem condition and relations were found between the flow, the diversity of macro-invertebrates and the concentration of dissolved O2 (DO). However, determining whether these impacts are unacceptable is difficult because Ecuador does not have established criteria for required ecological condition. This deterioration in ecological conditions can be minimized by applying more modern methods of environmental flow assessment such as the basic flow methodology (BFM) that allows the variability of the river flow. In the Macha{\textasciiacute} ngara River (3000--4000 m a.s.l.) an environmental flow of 27--51\% of the mean annual flow for the rainy season and 29--42\% in the dry season were determined by using BFM. Whereas for the Chulco River (3000--4000 m a.s.l.) the environmental flow was 15--45\% of the mean annual flow for the rainy season and 15--36\% for the dry season.},

  abstract = {Groundwater is a key driver of riparian condition on dryland rivers but is in high demand for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. Approaches are needed to guide decisions that balance human water needs while conserving riparian ecosystems. We developed a space-for-time substitution model that links groundwater change scenarios implemented within a Decision Support System (DSS) with proportions of floodplain vegetation types and abundances of breeding and migratory birds along the upper San Pedro River, AZ, USA. We investigated nine scenarios ranging from groundwater depletion to recharge. In groundwater decline scenarios, relative proportions of tall-canopied obligate phreatophytes (Populus/Salix, cottonwood/willow) on the floodplain progressively decline, and shrubbier species less dependent on permanent water sources (e.g. Tamarix spp., saltcedar) increase. These scenarios result in broad shifts in the composition of the breeding bird community, with canopynesting and water-obligate birds declining but midstory nesting birds increasing in abundance as groundwater declines. For the most extreme draw-down scenario where all reaches undergo groundwater declines, models project that only 10\% of the upper San Pedro floodplain would be comprised of cottonwood/willow (73\% saltcedar and 18\% mesquite), and abundances of canopy-nesting, water-obligate, and spring migrant birds would decline 48\%, 72\%, and 40\%, respectively. Groundwater recharge scenarios were associated with increases in canopy-nesting birds particularly given the extreme recharge scenario (all reaches regain shallow water tables and perennial streamflow). Model outputs serve to assess the sensitivity of biotic groups to potential changes in groundwater and thus to rank scenarios based on their expected ecological impacts.

  abstract = {Environmental flows (e-flows) aim to mitigate the threat of altered hydrological regimes in river systems and connected waterbodies and are an important component of integrated strategies to address multiple threats to freshwater biodiversity. Expanding and accelerating implementation of e-flows can support river conservation and help to restore the biodiversity and resilience of hydrologically altered and water-stressed rivers and connected freshwater ecosystems. While there have been significant developments in e-flow science, assessment, and societal acceptance, implementation of e-flows within water resource management has been slower than required and geographically uneven. This review explores critical factors that enable successful e-flow implementation and biodiversity outcomes in particular, drawing on 13 case studies and the literature. It presents e-flow implementation as an adaptive management cycle enabled by 10 factors: legislation and governance, financial and human resourcing, stakeholder engagement and co-production of knowledge, collaborative monitoring of ecological and social-economic outcomes, capacity training and research, exploration of trade-offs among water users, removing or retrofitting water infrastructure to facilitate e-flows and connectivity, and adaptation to climate change. Recognising that there may be barriers and limitations to the full and effective enablement of each factor, the authors have identified corresponding options and generalizable recommendations for actions to overcome prominent constraints, drawing on the case studies and wider literature. The urgency of addressing flow-related freshwater biodiversity loss demands collaborative networks to train and empower a new generation of e-flow practitioners equipped with the latest tools and insights to lead adaptive environmental water management globally. Mainstreaming e-flows within conservation planning, integrated water resource management, river restoration strategies, and adaptations to climate change is imperative. The policy drivers and associated funding commitments of the Kunming--Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework offer crucial opportunities to achieve the human benefits contributed by e-flows as nature-based solutions, such as flood risk management, floodplain fisheries restoration, and increased river resilience to climate change.},

  abstract = {Temporary streams and rivers, also referred to as intermittent, are defined as waterways that cease to flow at some points in space and time along their course. They are shaped by alternating wet and dry periods over annual and inter-annual cycles, making them one of the most dynamic freshwater ecosystems. These distinctive systems represent a substantial proportion of the total number, length and discharge of the global river network and are expected to become more widespread and face increasing pressures in many regions as a result of human activities and climate change. This collection of papers arose from the Conference on `Ecohydrology and Ecological Quality in Temporary Rivers' held at the University of Evora, Portugal, 12--14 September 2012. The primary objectives of the meeting were to bring together researchers and expertise from a range of temporary ecosystems, from small temporary Mediterranean and Californian streams to intermittent rivers from semi-arid and arid zones. A common thread through the discussions was the assessment of ecological conditions within these dynamic ecosystems. To undertake a 'condition assessment' is challenging because of the need to differentiate between biotic responses to anthropogenic pressures and natural variability associated with the hydro-climatology and disturbance regime typical of these systems, that is, drought, drying and flooding. The management of degraded intermittent streams and rivers presents many new challenges, not least how to reconcile ecological and societal goals for emerging `novel' ecosystems. Reconciliation ecology presents a realistic way of managing novel ecosystems given their value and desirable ecological services to society, rather than trying to restore to an original ecological state that may not be sustainable or economically possible.

  abstract = {Understanding the links between instream ecology and hydrology has become a critical task in contemporary river research and management. Habitat selection behaviour is a central dimension in applied ecology because it is a primary way that mobile organisms adapt to changing environmental conditions. Here, we analyzed brown trout habitat selection during two consecutive years in rivers presenting contrasting flow conditions to test the following hypotheses: (1) given that adaptation to flow regimes occurs as a response to the interaction between frequency, magnitude and predictability of mortality-causing events, habitat selection would vary across populations subject to different disturbance regimes; (2) because adaptations are directed towards enduring both intra-annual and interannual variations in flow, habitat selection would shift across years as a response to changing flow conditions and (3) such responses to yearly flow fluctuations would depend on the historical long-term hydrologic regime. We found that trout from rivers with highly variable flow and more frequent, longer and stronger extreme flow events were more willing to occupy positions in high-velocity habitats and showed stronger requirements for velocity refuges, whereas trout inhabiting more stable and benign flow environments selected visually-covered habitats to minimize biotic interactions. Results also revealed that trout shifted habitat selection patterns across years differing in flow conditions irrespective of river typology, but this shift was markedly stronger in rivers with higher flow variability and extremity. Overall, observed ecological patterns have strong implications for predicting the consequences of flow alteration for species adapted to particular flow regimes.

In rivers with altered flow regimes, restoring components of the natural flow regime is predicted to conserve freshwater biodiversity by supporting ecological functions and geomorphological processes to which native communities are adapted. However, the effectiveness of environmental flow restoration is poorly understood because of inadequate monitoring and uncertainty in ecological responses to managed changes in specific, quantifiable aspects of the annual streamflow regime. Here, we used time series models to analyze 25\,years of fish assemblage data collected before and after environmental flow implementation in a dammed river in California, USA. We examined the response of the fish community to changes in individual components of the flow regime known to support ecosystem functions. We found that as functional flow components shifted toward their predicted natural range, the quasi-extinction risk (likelihood of population declines of {$>$}80\%) decreased for the native fish assemblage. Following environmental flow implementation, observed changes toward natural ranges of dry season duration, fall pulse flow magnitude, and wet season timing each reduced quasi-extinction risk by at least 40\% for the native assemblage. However, functional flow components that shifted away from their predicted natural range, including lower spring recession flows and higher dry season baseflow, resulted in greater quasi-extinction risk for native species. In contrast, non-native species decreased in abundance when flow components shifted toward predicted natural ranges and increased when components shifted away from their natural range. Although most functional flow components remained outside of their natural range following environmental flow implementation, our results indicate that even moderate shifts toward a natural flow regime can benefit native and suppress non-native fish species. Overall, this study provides the most compelling evidence to date of the effectiveness of functional environmental flows in supporting native fish recovery in a highly regulated river.},

  abstract = {Reconciliation between water uses and sustaining aquatic species populations requires an effort to identify and quantify essential habitat characteristics for ecosystem health and valuation methods to predict ecosystem response to restoration actions. This process is particularly challenging for anadromous fish species such as California's Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, due to their limited geographic range and diverse life history habitat requirements. Tools, such as life-cycle models, are needed to manage population dynamics and quantify the composite effects of processes across space and time. Nevertheless, complex institutions can hinder result interpretation and communication, and limit model use in decision-making. This paper focuses on the federally endangered and endemic Sacramento River winter-run Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) by developing a Winter-Run Habitat-based Population Model (WRHAP). WRHAP is a conceptual, freshwater rearing stage model that includes alternative rearing habitats reported in the literature (e.g., floodplains, off-channel and tributaries), defines rules of habitat use based on instream conditions, and incorporates a juvenile growth module that combines bioenergetics modeling with empirical growth rates. Model outputs reasonably follow observed out-migration patterns and provide a realistic smolt size distribution arriving at the San Francisco Bay. This effort demonstrates the importance of currently ``non-critical'' habitats (as defined by the Endangered Species Act) for juvenile development, with floodplain habitat contributing to a quarter of out-migrating biomass (despite {$<$} 18\% availability and {$<$}10\% of total rearing days), and off-channel growth being one of the most sensitive parameters (explaining {\textasciitilde}13\% of average juvenile weight variance). The model shows the utility of a simple population model to explore relationships between habitat quality/quantity and juvenile development, and to assist water/ environmental management and decision-making processes focused on species recovery.},

The Santa Maria River, 200 km northwest of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, lies within the northern range of the federally endangered southern California steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and is a logical candidate for instream flow protection: the watershed historically supported the anadromous life history of this species, but fish must navigate the lowermost 39 km of the commonly dry mainstem river to move between the ocean and freshwater habitats in the upper watershed. Mainstem flows are partly controlled by Twitchell Dam, constructed across one of the Santa Maria River's two main tributaries in 1962. The dam is operated to maximize groundwater recharge through the bed of the mainstem Santa Maria River, thus minimizing discharge to the Pacific Ocean and so reducing already limited steelhead passage opportunities. Conventional criteria for determining suitable instream flows for steelhead passage are ill-suited to intermittent, Mediterranean-type rivers because they ignore the dynamic channel morphology and critical importance of headwater flows in providing cues that once presaged passage-adequate mainstem discharges but no longer do so. Hydrologic analysis of pre-dam flows, coupled with established criteria for successful O. mykiss migration, provides an objective basis for evaluating alternative dam-management scenarios for enhancing steelhead passage, although their implementation would redirect some water that for the past half-century has exclusively supported irrigated agriculture and municipal water supplies.

  abstract = {Regional habitat and fisheries management planningrequires estimates of the capacity of watersheds to produce salmonids. To predict the average abundance of smolts of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch produced by streams and rivers, we related estimates of smolt abundance to habitat features derived from maps and discharge records. We assembled a database of 474 annual estimates of smolt abundance from 86 streams in western North America for this analysis. We found that only stream length and to a lesser extent latitude were useful in predicting mean smolt abundance. The frequency distribution of annual estimates of smolt abundance from individual streams tended towards a normal rather than the more usual lognormal distribution; the median coefficient of variation in abundance was 37\%. Our results are consistent with the view that, on average, smolt abundance is limited by spatial habitat, but that there is significant annual variation in abundance probably due to variation in habitat quality caused by climate, flow, or other factors. We conclude that forecasting smoll yield from stream length and latitude is feasible at the watershed or regional level, but that the precision of a prediction for a single stream is poor. A more detailed approach will be required for local forecasting.},

These tools should ideally be transferrable across different river catchments. This study presents a hydroecological model indicating that macroinvertebrates were not resilient to long-term, steady-state levels of groundwater abstraction when flows at Q75 were reduced by more than 50\% in unpolluted streams in the West Midlands of England. The proportion of silt and clay covering the substratum and distance from source were also significant predictors of ecological condition, but did not interact with the abstraction effect. Combinations of different biotic indices and supplementary field observations of catchment land use gave additional evidence of the impacts of excessive inputs of fine sediment overriding the effects of abstraction at some locations. This study has shown that regional hydroecological models can be used with existing environmental flow indicators and other local environmental information as a weight of evidence to identify where abstraction and excessive inputs of fine sediment need to be mitigated separately or together to achieve the full ecological benefits. Such regional hydroecological models can increase the certainty of regulatory decisions made at the local scale for licencing abstraction at current use and predicted future levels.},

  abstract = {If ecological management of river ecosystems is to keep pace with increasing pressure to abstract, divert and dam, we must develop general flow--ecology relationships to predict the impacts of these hydrologic alterations. Regional flow gradient analyses are a promising tool to quickly reveal these functional relationships, but there are considerable uncertainties in this method because of variability in the historical extent of flow data across different rivers, combined with multiple indices characterizing the ecological attributes of flow regimes. In response, we outline an objective framework for analysing spatial hydrologic gradients that addresses three major sources of uncertainty: robust estimation of flow indices, the potential for temporal trends to confound spatial variation in flow regimes and the statistical robustness to detect underlying hydrological gradients. The utility of our framework was examined in relation to flow regimes across multiple braided river catchments in Canterbury, New Zealand. We found that a subset of flow indices could be robustly estimated using only 10 years of flow data, although indices that captured flow `timing' required longer time series. Temporal trends were unlikely to confound conclusions from a spatial hydrologic gradient analysis, and there were three statistically supported hydrologic gradients related to flow magnitude, flow variability and low flow events. The widespread application of robust spatial flow gradient analyses has the potential to further our understanding of how altered flow regimes affect the ecology of freshwater and riparian ecosystems, thereby providing the evidence base to inform river management.

We illustrate this framework with a case study, whereby fish community responses to various water-management scenarios were predicted in a partially regulated river system at a local watershed scale. This case study simulates management scenarios based on interactive effects of dam operation protocols, withdrawals for municipal water supply, effluent discharges from wastewater treatment, and inter-basin water transfers. Modeled streamflow was integrated with flow--ecology relationships relating hydrologic departure from reference conditions to fish species richness, stratified by trophic, reproductive, and habitat characteristics. Adding a hypothetical new water-withdrawal site was predicted to increase the frequency of low-flow conditions with adverse effects for several fish groups. Imposition of new reservoir release requirements was predicted to enhance flow and fish species richness immediately downstream of the reservoir, but these effects were dissipated further downstream. The framework presented here can be used to translate flow--ecology relationships into evidence-based management by developing decision-support systems for conservation of riverine biodiversity while optimizing water availability for human use.},

Here, three biotic indices were used. The Saginaw River Basin, the largest watershed in Michigan was selected for this study. Since no know modeling package exists to evaluate the impacts of climate change on these biotic indices, a coupled modeling approach was proposed. First, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was setup to estimate streamflow and water quality for all stream segments. Next, the results from the SWAT model in combination with long-term biological monitoring data were used to develop biotic indices predictive models using a two-phase approach. An assemblage of 42 climate scenarios (2040--2060) were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which are biased corrected and statistically downscaled. The dataset provides two extreme Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to account for best (RCP 4.5) and worst (RCP 8.5) case scenarios. The climate data were incorporated in SWAT and biotic indices predictive models to understand stream health conditions in the watershed. Results showed that the majority of streams have a probability of declining in values of biotic indices while streams that currently have excellent conditions are the most vulnerable streams to the climate change. This modeling approach provides a new mean to link more strongly biota indicators with flow regime indicators, which is of prime interest for the implementation of ecohydrology principles.},

We tested how forecasting of species abundances depends on the number and strength of interactions and on model size (number of predictors). We also tested how greater system complexity (i.e. the fluctuating temperatures) impacted these relations. We found that the more interactions a species had, the weaker these interactions were and the better its abundance was predicted. Forecast skill increased with model size. Greater system complexity decreased forecast skill for three out of eight species.

  abstract = {Many frameworks have been used to identify environmental flows for sustaining river ecosystems or specific taxa in the face of widespread flow alteration. However, these frameworks largely focus on identifying suitable flows and often ignore the important links between management actions, resulting flows, and valued ecosystem or social responses. Structured decision making (SDM) could assist the comparison of environmental flows by providing a mature framework to link management actions to objectives via environmental flow science. We describe SDM and illustrate its application using a case study focused on comparing environmental flow scenarios for the mainstem Willamette River, Oregon. In a short timeframe, SDM was applied to identify objectives, develop empirical and expert opinion-based models, and compare flow scenarios while accounting for interannual flow variability and partial controllability. No scenario was clearly preferred based on available knowledge, largely because river flows could only be partially controlled through dam operations. Participants agreed that SDM was useful for comparing alternative dam operations, but that refined predictive models and additional objectives were needed to better inform basinwide flow decisions. In our view, SDM can provide more realistic comparisons of environmental flows by accounting for partial controllability and uncertainty, which may result in greater implementation of available flow management actions.},

  abstract = {Two foundational questions about sustainability are ``How are ecosystems and the services they provide going to change in the future?'' and ``How do human decisions affect these trajectories?'' Answering these questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes. Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.},

  abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the `folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of {\textbar}r{\textbar} {$>$}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

  abstract = {The functional flows model integrates hydrogeomorphic processes and ecological functions for stream physical habitat evaluations. Functional flows are discharge values that serve ecological uses. Assessments of functional flows are based on evaluation of shear stress dynamics. The analysis is based on the occurrence of sediment transport regimes defined by threshold values of Shields stress estimated from discharge (Q), a parameter ( f) governing depth response to incremental discharge changes, water surface slope (S) and media grain size (D50). As an example, the model was tuned for fall-run Chinook salmon spawning. Ecological functions studied were bed occupation (spawning, incubation and emergence) and bed preparation (river bed reworking periods)---both reliant on shear stress dynamics. A numerical experiment and sensitivity analysis using a wide range of realistic values of input variables indicated the effect of each variable on flow functionality. Combinations of S {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01, D50 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 m, f {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and four sediment transport stages produced 144 scenarios. Ranges of functional flows were greater for scenarios for low f (0.2) with low slope (0.001,0.05), for high f (0.5) with small grain size (0.02 m) and for intermediate low f (0.3) with coarse grain size (0.1 m). The functional flows model incorporates in-stream habitat processes by including metrics of hydrologic, hydraulic, geomorphic and ecologic dynamics. Model uncertainties related to input data, calculation algorithms, and model structure are analysed. Functional flows analysis can be useful in studying water management alternatives to improve habitat conditions for target species and lifestages. Copyright \# 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the literature for positive deviance applied to health outcomes informed by PRISMA-ScR. We searched the literature from 1945 to 2020, including articles on positive deviance or positive outliers, and restricted to examining individual rather than organizational outcomes. We analyzed the methodology applied including the process of identifying deviants, the use of control groups, and the degree of community engagement. Results: Our initial search identified 1140 manuscripts; we included 104 papers describing 98 studies, 11 topical and one miscellaneous category. Most studies used objective measures of health or survey-based responses to identify deviants from a sub-set of the population at risk. The use of controls was less common in some topics (hospital infections), whereas controls were universally applied in other topics (malnutrition). The degree of community engagement varied widely. Conclusions: Positive deviance would benefit from improvements in reporting and standardized approaches to defining deviance. Studies could be improved through clarified definitions of deviance/risk, explicit descriptions of community engagement, and more consistent use of controls.},

The annual lowest water level of the East Dongting Lake had gradually risen and the annual water level amplitude had decreased obviously over the past 60 years. Since the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, the average water level increased significantly from January to June. The Three Gorges Dam holder the incoming water from late September to late October that the status will change from flood control limited water level to normal water level, meanwhile the water level of East Dongting Lake declined significantly through the same duration, especially in October. The operation of the Three Gorges Dam decreased flooding days in the areas above 22-m elevation, resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation-covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern. As the timing of water level recession at elevations of 24--27 m were 12, 17, 19 and 16 days earlier than that in 1981--2002, the optimum elevation for Carex growth decreased from 25--26 m to 24--25 m. After the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, the annual reversal times of water level increased significantly, which is not conducive to the formation of stable habitat and the utilization of resources by organisms.},

  abstract = {Macroinvertebrates' response to hydromorphological alterations and regulated flows along lowland rivers is still poorly known despite ecohydrology's fundamental role in river science. Along the Oglio River (Northern Italy), several water abstractions and dams break it into segments with varying hydraulic and morphological properties. Three types of a priori different environments were identified (dammed, downstream and free flowing sections), and macroinvertebrate communities were sampled from each zone. This study aimed (i) to investigate patterns of macroinvertebrate communities along a regulated lowland river by testing the a priori zones; (ii) to find macroinvertebrate taxa that served as indicators of the various hydrological conditions and (iii) to verify hydromorphological control over ecological macroinvertebrate traits resulting in different trait values in each identified zone. Macroinvertebrate community was characterized in a total of 63 stations by means of two quantitative approaches, each exploring a surface of 0.5 m2. The lowest richness values were found in dammed sites that tended toward lentic conditions. Ecnomidae (dammed zones), Limoniidae (downstream zones) and Heptageniidae (free flowing section) were identified as the best indicators of varying hydrological conditions. As suggested by the results of 4th Corner Method, environmental constraints define communities with different ecological traits. These results highlight hydromorphological control over macroinvertebrate community structure and reflect how regulated flows affect the Oglio River in terms of biodiversity, indicator taxa and ecological traits. The authors wish to stress the importance of considering the ecological effects of dams and impoundments on river systems in upstream areas as well as downstream.

However, assessments of these impacts on the freshwater fish distribution are still scarce. We investigated whether an artificial flow regime generated by discharges from an aqueduct would promote a longitudinal environmental gradient in an off-river reservoir. We tested the hypothesis that the incoming water from aqueduct discharges promotes environmental gradient between lotic and lentic conditions. We expect that environmental changes and the artificial flow regime promote the structuring of fish assemblage and that the lotic-lentic transition areas present the highest fish species richness. A longitudinal gradient in environmental characteristics with differing fish assemblage structure was found. Temporal changes in the fish assemblages occurred only in areas near the discharge of the aqueduct. The highest fish richness and diversity were recorded in the transition zone during the wet season, associated with the greater environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone, whereas the lowest was found in the lotic zone, probably associated with the altered flow regime. The greatest abundance was recorded in the upper lentic zone in the wet season, whereas the lowest was found in the lower lentic zone in both seasons. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that the artificial flow regime, modulated by the seasonality of discharges and the influence of environmental variables, promotes longitudinal gradients in reservoirs when rivers are not present. The findings are relevant in a scenario where ever more interconnections of aquatic bodies have been diffused around the world.},

This model was used to predict                     FSR                     values for all twelve-digit Hydrological Unit Code catchments (                     HUC                     -12s) in the North Carolina Piedmont under current flow conditions and under water withdrawal, climate change and impervious surface scenarios.                                                                                             Flow--ecology modeling results indicate that predicted                     FSR                     declined significantly with increased water withdrawals. However, the magnitude of decline varied geographically. A ``hot-spot'' analysis was conducted based on predicted changes in                     FSR                     under each scenario to understand which                     HUC                     -12s were most likely to be affected by changes in water withdrawals, climate and impervious surfaces. Under the 20\% withdrawal increase scenario, 413 of 886 (47\%)                     HUC                     -12s in the study area were predicted to lose one or more species.                     HUC                     -12s in the Broad, Catawba, Yadkin and Cape Fear river basins were most susceptible to species loss.                                                                                             These findings may help decision making efforts by identifying catchments most vulnerable to changing water availability. Additionally,                     FSR                     -discharge modeling results can assist resource agencies, water managers and stakeholders in assessing the effect of water withdrawals in catchments to better support the protection and long-term conservation of species.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Models based on ecological processes (process-explicit models) are often used to predict ecosystem responses to environmental changes or management scenarios. However, models are imperfect and need to be validated, ideally by testing their assumptions and outputs against independent empirical data sets. Examples of validation of process-explicit models are rare. Recently, stochastic population models have been developed to predict the likely responses (over 10--120\,years) of a riverine fish (golden perch,               Macquaria ambigua               ) to flow management in the Murray--Darling Basin (MDB) in eastern Australia, one of the world's most regulated river basins. Declines in golden perch (and other species) are a direct consequence of altered hydrology, and managers require information to predict how fish will respond to possible future hydrological conditions to guide substantial investments in flow management. Here, we use two independent field data sets to validate our population model. We compared model predictions to observed trends to ask: (1) How do predicted population sizes and growth rates compare with observed data? (2) Does the correlation between predicted and observed population sizes and growth rates vary among populations? (3) Does the correlation between predicted and observed population sizes and growth rates vary across observed hydrological conditions? (4) How do modeled and observed fish movement rates compare? We found reasonable correlations between fish population sizes and growth rates as predicted by the model and observed in independent data sets for several populations (Aim 1), but the strength of these correlations varied among populations (Aim 2) and hydrological conditions (Aim 3). Predicted and observed fish movement rates were strongly correlated (Aim 4). Population models are frequently used in conservation decision-making but are rarely validated. We demonstrate that: (1) validation can identify model strengths and weaknesses; (2) observed data sets often have inherent limitations that can preclude robust validations; (3) validation is likely to be more common if appropriate observed data sets are available; and (4) validation should consider the purpose of modeling. Wider consideration of these messages would contribute to more critical examinations of models, so they can be most appropriately used in conservation decision-making.},

To improve the scientific basis of riparian restoration, the clearing understanding of the dynamic of eco-hydrological system and the feedback between hydrological and ecological components are needed. A fully distributed eco-hydrological model combines a hydrology component based on the modified MODFLOW, with a vegetation dynamic component described by Verhulst logistic equation. The validation of the eco-hydrological model using groundwater well observation, river stage observation and remote sensing data demonstrated that the good capability of the model in simulating the dynamic of the eco-hydrological system in lower reach of Tarim River. The interaction between the hydrological component and ecological component has been revealed through water balance analysis and scenario studies. Vegetation has a significant impact on groundwater evapotranspiration, groundwater storage change and groundwater depth, while groundwater depth is a critical feedback variable that determines the vegetation dynamics, which is shown by observation and simulation result. The eco-hydrological model represented in this study could help to groundwater dependent ecosystem restoration and protection, particularly for riparian ecosystem.},

Data were collected at nine times (seven springs and two autumns) over a 14-year period of variable hydrological conditions, including years of flood and extreme unprecedented drought.                                                     The taxonomic and trait structures of communities were similar during wet and average springs but became increasingly different as drought continued and smaller streams became intermittent.                                                     The density of total invertebrates, primarily chironomids, increased during the drought years, but the richness and abundance of mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly (EPT) taxa declined during the late drought. During the late drought, the proportions of rheophilic, semivoltine taxa with clinger or swimmer behavioural habits decreased, whereas small, stress-tolerant taxa with burrower and climber habits increased. Collector--gatherers dominated in all periods, but during the severe drought the relative abundance of micropredators increased and filterers, shredders, and grazers decreased.

Invertebrate richness and EPT abundance decreased and community structure showed large changes when stream discharge fell below 1--10~L/s, but remained relatively constant across a range of higher flows. During the severe drought, there were significant declines in the densities of 40\% of the common EPT taxa compared to average and wet years, but chironomid, mite, and other invertebrate taxa showed variable responses.

Optimization modeling has been widely used in other forms of conservation management and an increasing body of literature documents the development of optimization models that could be used to improve environmental water decisions. This paper reviews this disparate research, showing that there are a range of different questions addressed using this modeling approach and that the representation of environmental outcomes varies.

Hydro-economic models (HEMs) of human-natural systems can play a positive role toward successful groundwater management by yielding valuable knowledge and insight. The current study explores how an HEM that captures essential physical and economic characteristics of a system can shed light on the system's processes and dynamics to benefit stakeholders, managers, and also researchers. These propositions are illustrated using the Harney Basin, Oregon, which has seen large groundwater declines in the past 20 years. The HEM shows that: (a) although current groundwater pumping rates will gradually raise costs and reduce well yields, irrigators gain the highest aggregate economic return by continuing current pumping; (b) lowland areas of the basin are hydrologically connected, which limits the efficacy of remedies focused on regulations only in some portions of the basin; (c) community expectations regarding the efficacy of several proposed solutions are overly optimistic; and (d) the study's scenarios identify interventions that would stabilize the groundwater system and prevent additional adverse impacts on residential and livestock wells and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. These interventions would require limiting groundwater pumping by nearly half and reducing annual profits by \$7.5--\$9.0M. The HEM also demonstrated its value to researchers: its insights shifted attention toward questions about Oregon's existing groundwater institutions and their inability to adaptively manage the transition from abundant groundwater to scarce groundwater in a timely manner.},

  abstract = {Widespread declines in stocks of Pacific salmon in the genus Oncorhynchus highlight the need for research to find new and effective management strategies for recovery. Two recovery objectives are (1) to ensure that recruitment is adequate to rebuild self-sustaining populations and (2) to maintain phenotypic diversity. This study seeks to understand how seasonal flow patterns in a flow-regulated California river might be managed to attain each of these recovery objectives, specifically for the fall and late-fall runs of chinook salmon O. tshawytscha. We ask two questions: (1) Does the optimal pattern of seasonal flows change as the amount of water available is constrained by droughts or diversions of flows? and (2) How do optimal flow regimes designed for the two conservation objectives differ? We coupled simulated annealing with a recruitment model to find flow regimes that maximize either the number of smolt out-migrant ``recruits'' (MR) or the variation in spawning times among recruits (MV). Optimal flow regimes identified for both the MR and MV objectives changed as we increased the annual quantity of water available, allocating higher flows during the spring and fall seasons. Flow regimes that optimized the MR and MV objectives were different. For example, the MV flow regime with unlimited annual flow provided a pulse of high flow 2 weeks before the peak spawning date of the minority late-fall run. Simulated recruits produced by MV flow regimes were fewer in number---and had parents that spawned later and over a wider range of dates---than recruits produced by MR flow regimes. Although these results have not been verified by empirical studies, they demonstrate the potential for managing species with special conservation status by combining state-of-the-art numerical optimization methods with mechanistic ecological models.},

  abstract = {Hydroelectric power provides a cheap source of electricity with few carbon emissions. Yet, reservoirs are not operated sustainably, which we define as meeting societal needs for water and power while protecting long-term health of the river ecosystem. Reservoirs that generate hydropower are typically operated with the goal of maximizing energy revenue, while meeting other legal water requirements. Reservoir optimization schemes used in practice do not seek flow regimes that maximize aquatic ecosystem health. Here, we review optimization studies that considered environmental goals in one of three approaches. The first approach seeks flow regimes that maximize hydropower generation, while satisfying legal requirements, including environmental (or minimum) flows. Solutions from this approach are often used in practice to operate hydropower projects. In the second approach, flow releases from a dam are timed to meet water quality constraints on dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and nutrients. In the third approach, flow releases are timed to improve the health of fish populations. We conclude by suggesting three steps for bringing multi-objective reservoir operation closer to the goal of ecological sustainability: (1) conduct research to identify which features of flow variation are essential for river health and to quantify these relationships, (2) develop valuation methods to assess the total value of river health and (3) develop optimal control softwares that combine water balance modelling with models that predict ecosystem responses to flow.

  abstract = {Using models to represent relationships between flow and fishes has important practical applications for managing reservoir releases. Attempts to model such relationships often neglect indirect mechanisms by which flow influences fish. For example, growth of salmon juveniles is measurably faster when flows inundate floodplain and promote higher production of invertebrate prey, but out-of-channel flows have not yet been incorporated into models. The QUANTUS model developed here represents indirect linkages between flow and freshwater survival, mediated by temperature and prey availability, for fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Quantiles of spawning time and place were used to define cohorts of salmon in a regulated Central Valley, California river. Survival of these quantile-cohorts was simulated through incubation, juvenile growth, and eventual downstream migration. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the seasonal timing of pulse flows. Simulated survival was highest for flow regimes that provided a modest, temperature-moderating pulse flow in early summer and, for wetter years, a second, larger pulse of over-bank flow in late winter. For many rivers of the Pacific coast that support fall Chinook salmon, the thermal window of opportunity for spawning and rearing is narrow. Optimized flows made the most of this window by providing access to accelerated juvenile growth and early survival in floodplain habitat, a result that should be verified with field experiments. Timing of optimized pulse flows differed in some respects from the region's natural hydrograph, dominated by spring runoff. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms by which flow influences fishes can be important when shaping flows in the changed context of a regulated river.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase weather extremes and variability, including more frequent weather whiplashes or extreme swings between severe drought and extraordinarily wet years. Shifts in precipitation patterns will alter stream flow regimes, affecting critical life history stages of sensitive aquatic organisms. Understanding how threatened fish species, such as steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), are affected by stream flows in years with contrasting environmental conditions is important for their conservation. Here, we report how extreme wet and dry years, from 2015 to 2018, affected stream flow patterns in two tributaries to the South Fork Eel River, California, USA, and aspects of O. mykiss ecology, including over-summer fish growth and body condition as well as spring out-migration timing. We found that stream flow patterns differed across years in the timing and magnitude of large winter--spring flow events and in summer low-flow levels. We were surprised to find that differences in stream flows did not impact growth, body condition, or timing of out-migration of O. mykiss. Fish growth was limited in the late summer in these streams (average of 0.02 0.05 mm/d), but was similar across dry and wet years, and so was end-of-summer body condition and pool-specific biomass loss from the beginning to the end of the summer. Similarly, O. mykiss migrated out of tributaries during the last week of March/first week of April regardless of the timing of spring flow events. We suggest that the muted response to interannual hydrologic variability is due to the high quality of habitat provided by these unimpaired, groundwater-fed tributaries. Similar streams that are likely to maintain cool temperatures and sufficient base flows, even in the driest years, should be a high priority for conservation and restoration efforts.},

  abstract = {Environmental high flows are being implemented in many flow-regulated rivers globally. The questions arise as to whether different rivers respond similarly to artificial floods, and what are the long-term ecological consequences of such flood programs? This study evaluated abiotic/biotic dynamics during experimental floods in two rivers with contrasting valley morphologies (canyon-confined vs open-valley) as well as long-term response patterns of macroinvertebrates in both rivers to 16 years of experimental floods. Both systems showed an increase in measured parameters (turbidity, total phosphorus, drift, seston) during the rising limb of the flood with subsequent decreases being observed before the falling limb of the flood (all parameters displayed typical hysteresis patterns with discharge). Contrasting differences existed in respect to immediate effects of these two floods on macroinvertebrates and benthic periphyton (decreases or no change). Over the long term, major channel changes occurred from initial floods with less change observed from later floods in both systems. Macroinvertebrate densities fluctuated seasonally, but showed no long-term response to the flood program, whereas taxa richness increased in both systems. The rivers differed in macroinvertebrate community structure and this was reflected in shifts in community assembly over the study period in both systems (being substantially greater in the system flowing through a confined valley). The results suggest that immediate flood effects are quite similar among rivers, even over multiple years, but long-term trajectories in community assembly reflect changes in local habitat conditions in respect to external drivers such as landscape geomorphology.},

Modeling and monitoring can be integrated with experiments to analyze long-term ecological responses.

  abstract = {Abstract. In undammed watersheds in Mediterranean climates, the timing and abruptness of the transition from the dry season to the wet season have major implications for aquatic ecosystems. Of particular concern in many coastal areas is whether this transition can provide sufficient flows at the right time to allow passage for spawning anadromous fish, which is determined by dry season baseflow rates and the timing of the onset of the rainy season. In (semi-) ephemeral watershed systems, these functional flows also dictate the timing of full reconnection of the stream system. In this study, we propose methods to predict, approximately 5~months in advance, two key hydrologic metrics in the undammed rural Scott River watershed in northern California. The two metrics are intended to characterize (1)~the severity of a dry year and (2)~the relative timing of the transition from the dry to the wet season. The ability to predict these metrics in advance could support seasonal adaptive management. The first metric is the minimum 30\,d dry season baseflow volume, Vmin, which occurs at the end of the dry season (September--October) in this Mediterranean climate. The second metric is the cumulative precipitation, starting 1~September, necessary to bring the watershed to a ``full'' or ``spilling'' condition (i.e.,~initiate the onset of wet season storm- or baseflows) after the end of the dry season, referred to here as Pspill. As potential predictors of these two metrics, we assess maximum snowpack, cumulative precipitation, the timing of the snowpack and precipitation, spring groundwater levels, spring river flows, reference evapotranspiration, and a subset of these metrics from the previous water year. Though many of these predictors are correlated with the two metrics of interest, we find that the best prediction for both metrics is a linear combination of the maximum snowpack water content and total October--April precipitation. These two linear models could reproduce historical values of Vmin and Pspill with an average model error~(RMSE) of 1.4\,Mm3 per 30\,d (19.4~cfs) and 25.4\,mm (1~in.), corresponding to 49\,\% and 37\,\% of mean observed values, respectively. Although these predictive indices could be used by governance entities to support local water management, careful consideration of baseline conditions used as a basis for prediction is necessary.},

However, flow restoration projects often lack appropriate monitoring and replication. The Rh{\^o}ne restoration project has included repeated flow changes, in four bypassed reaches of the river, where the increase in minimum daily flow varied from minimal change to a tenfold increase.                                                                        Fish communities ({$>$}55~000 individuals of 36 species) were electrofished at nine sites in the main channels of the four bypassed reaches, for 2--9~years before and for 5--10~years after the flow restoration. An instream hydraulic habitat model, published before restoration and based on observations of fish microhabitat preferences in independent reaches, was applied to the bypassed reaches to predict density changes for 14 species that accounted for 94\% of the total fish abundance.                                                     In the two bypassed reaches where minimum flow was considerably increased (fivefold and tenfold), the abundance of species preferring fast-flowing and deep microhabitats increased by factors of 1.9 and 2.4, respectively, whereas the abundance of other species strongly decreased. Predicted changes in density made using the habitat model for these two reaches agreed with the observations at several sites and involved several fish species. In contrast, in the two bypassed reaches where flow changes were less, the observed changes in density were weak and less related to the model predictions.                                                     Hydraulic habitat models predicted changes of fish populations and the predictions also explained observed community responses to the changed flows. Ten years after the first flow restoration, our results suggest that the Rh{\^o}ne restoration generated perennial changes of the fish community structure, reversing community patterns that were observed prior to the flow restoration.},

  abstract = {Ecohydraulics is a relatively new name for a long-standing field investigating the interactions between ecology and the physics of flowing water. In recent decades, a burgeoning literature has developed relating species' densities to environmental variables, particularly those associated with flow. These abundance--environment relations (AERs) are sometimes used in habitat-based association models (HAMs) to predict changes to species' abundances, especially human-caused changes to the environment. Unfortunately, some conclusions arising from AERs are based on untenable ecological assertions or faulty assumptions including: illogical inference of cause-and-effect, muddling of hypotheses such as `habitat preference' with other causal mechanisms, outdated ideas about environmental tolerance and optimization. Furthermore, the effects of biological interactions in AERs are routinely ignored, when biological interactions form the core of most modern models in community ecology. HAMs underpinned by AERs are often used to predict changes in populations, but lack information on demographic rates (births, deaths, migration), which are essential for population-level predictions. These weaknesses are discussed at length and, we suggest, must be acknowledged and surmounted if ecohydraulics is to advance our understanding of stream ecosystems and our capacity to manage streams. We give two examples of research at the ecological--physical interface that are grounded in ecological principles: (1) how flow influences feeding rates of filter-feeding insects (Simuliidae and Hydropsychidae) and the consequences for larval growth rates, adult body size and fecundity, and (2) how the physical factors that determine the density of rocks emergent from the water's surface may affect population densities of insects where females lay their eggs on emergent rocks. Ecohydraulics is an interdisciplinary field that requires expertise in both ecology and hydraulics, and true interdisciplinary teams may have the best prospects of addressing the many unanswered and untackled questions.

Two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models are frequently used to evaluate water management alternatives concerning aquatic species physical habitat needs or preferences. Recent studies have assessed the timing or duration of suitable habitat conditions, but no standardized approach exists to integrate and interpret ecohydraulic model outputs within a water management framework. Such an approach is needed to maximize the information obtained from model outputs and to facilitate communication between river scientists and water managers. This study presents a general framework to aggregate and summarize 2D hydraulic model outputs by adapting the traditional water resources metrics of reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and sustainability. Just as these metrics are typically used to quantify distinct aspects of water resources performance, applying them to ecohydraulic conditions facilitates interpretation of ecological performance and human-ecosystem water management tradeoffs. This paper examines the utility and limitations of the proposed framework and metrics in a simple application to fall-run Chinook salmon in a typical Mediterranean-montane stream.},

In part, this reflects the challenge of understanding the ecological effects of flow variability over different temporal and spatial domains. Here, we use a process-based distributed hydrological model to simulate 23 years of natural flow regime in 100 bioassessment sites across the Adige River network (NE Italy), and to identify typical nivo-glacial, nivo-pluvial, and pluvial reaches. We then applied spatial stream-network models (SSN) to investigate the relationships between hydrologic and macroinvertebrate metrics while accounting for network spatial autocorrelation and local habitat conditions. Macroinvertebrate metrics correlated most strongly with summer, winter, and temporal variation in streamflow, but effects varied across flow regime types. For example (i) taxon richness appeared limited by high summer flows and high winter flows in nivo-glacial and pluvial streams, respectively; (ii) invertebrate grazers increased proportionally with the annual coefficient of flow variation in nivo-glacial streams but tended to decline with flow variation in pluvial streams. Although local land-use and water quality also affected benthic communities, most variation in macroinvertebrate metrics was associated with spatial autocorrelation. These findings highlight the importance of developing environmental flow management policies in ways that reflect specific hydro-ecological and land use contexts. Our analyses also illustrate the importance of spatiallyexplicit approaches that account for auto-correlation when quantifying flow-ecology relationships.},

Ideally, water managers could derive these thresholds empirically from hydroecological studies. Unfortunately, recent synthesis studies suggest that clear thresholds for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are elusive -- if they exist at all. The field of ecological risk assessment (ERA) offers many approaches to describe and manage the prevalence and threat of an environmental stressor and establish limits of that stressor. This study introduces a hydroecological risk assessment (HERA) to identify thresholds of hydrologic alteration using an approach from ecological risk assessment and a stressor derived from publicly available hydrologic data. Rather than a single threshold value for ecological responses to hydrologic alteration, this study found that species exhibit variable patterns of response to depletion across their ranges --what we term Species Depletion Profiles (SDPs). These SDPs correlate with population health of the species in question, with similarities in conservation status and distribution evident among species with similar SDPs. Our results suggest that a well-used approach common to aquatic ecotoxicology has potential application in developing environmental flow guidelines for protection and remediation of riverine systems subject to anthropogenic influences where specific flow-ecology relationships are unknown.},

Despite this, little is known about the hydro-biogeochemical interactions within these ecosystems. A review of existing literature on spring-fed rivers, coupled with a decade of research on volcanic spring-fed rivers of northern California, finds that these systems are exceptionally productive and exhibit stable environmental conditions. These unique conditions stem from hydrogeologic processes typical of young volcanic terrains. Aquatic macrophytes, common to some nutrient-rich spring-fed systems, play a disproportionate role in hydrologic and geomorphic processes by facilitating ecological interactions and velocity conditions that improve juvenile salmonid growth. We find that volcanic spring-fed rivers are also resilient to climate change, due not only to their ability to dampen water temperature changes through deep groundwater flow but also because of their nutrient-driven high ecosystem productivity, which may enable coldwater species to metabolically compensate for marginal increases in water temperature. Understanding the fundamental geomorphic and ecological differences between these rare ecosystems and their numerically dominant runoff rivers is essential for developing long-term conservation strategies for coldwater species under a rapidly changing climate.},

  abstract = {Conservation efforts for Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) increasingly prioritize maintenance of cool water temperatures that protect all freshwater life stages. However, development of appropriate temperature standards requires a robust understanding of the interactions among water temperature, ecosystem productivity, and fish performance. We used a series of in situ enclosures to examine how natural spatiotemporal gradients in thermal conditions and prey availability affected the summer growth and survival of age-0+ coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Coho salmon absolute growth rates peaked at a mean daily average water temperature (mean T) of 16.6 {$^\circ$}C and an associated maximum weekly maximum temperature (MWMT) of 21.1 {$^\circ$}C. Juvenile growth under these thermal conditions was sixfold greater than the growth rates observed for conspecifics rearing in the coolest study reach (mean T = 13.0 {$^\circ$}C; MWMT = 16.0 {$^\circ$}C). Even at the highest rearing temperature (mean T = 18.1 {$^\circ$}C; MWMT = 24.0 {$^\circ$}C), growth rates remained positive and above the study-wide average, although overall survival was reduced. Among the predictor variables examined, invertebrate prey abundance was the predominant factor influencing age-0+ coho salmon growth. These results suggest that abundant prey resources may mitigate the negative effects of elevated water temperature on fish growth in riverine environments. Given the likelihood of increasing stream temperatures with climate change, productive ecosystems may provide critical refuges for juvenile salmonids.},

  abstract = {Groundwater-dependent cities face increasing population and changes in urban land use, threatening long-term aquifer sustainability by simultaneously increasing pumping demand while modifying recharge rates. Aquifer management involves a portfolio of alternatives to balance the sustainability of multiple water supply sources, including novel recharge alternatives to supplement traditional groundwater and surface water sources. However, potential managed aquifer recharge solutions can lead to unintended consequences as modern infrastructure and management alter natural hydrology, changing the underlying groundwater paradigm. This study uses a multiobjective analysis approach to evaluate the performance of spatially distributed aquifer management alternatives for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), a region where the population has increased by 48\% and urban land use by 35\% in the last 30 years. Recharge alternatives are evaluated using a physically based groundwater model that incorporates land and water use trends, and include: repairs to the water supply distribution network, increased wastewater treatment and infiltration, and increased infiltration of imported water supplies. These alternatives are compared according to planning objectives aggregated over three overlapping subregions within the model to minimize energy use for pumping, minimize water quality risks in subsidence-prone areas, and minimize groundwater flooding in urban areas. Results indicate that management alternatives resulting in equivalent changes in storage can exhibit spatially distinct reductions in drawdown over the historical period. Additionally, combining multiple alternatives results in a more than an additive risk of groundwater flooding, demonstrating the need for mitigation of rising water tables. This model will serve as the basis for future spatial optimization studies under future climate and land use scenarios. These approaches have broad applicability in other rapidly urbanizing regions dependent on groundwater supplies.},

A regional framework for biologically based flow management can help catchment managers prioritise streams for protection, evaluate impacts of disturbance or interventions and provide a starting point for causal assessment in degraded streams. However, lack of flow data limit the ability to assess hydrologic conditions across a region.                                                     Hydrologic models can address this problem. Regionally calibrated hydrologic models were used to estimate current and reference flows at 572 bioassessment sites in southern and central coastal California. Flow alteration was characterised as the difference in 39 flow metrics calculated from simulations of present-day and reference flow time-series, calculated under up to four precipitation conditions.                                                                          Biological condition was assessed with the California Stream Condition Index (                     CSCI                     ) and its components. Logistic regressions were used to predict the likelihood of high scores (i.e. {$\geq$}10th percentile of the                     CSCI                     reference calibration data). Statistically significant relationships between increasing severity of hydrologic alteration and decreasing biological condition were used to set thresholds that reflected tolerance for risk of a stakeholder advisory group.                                                                                             An index of hydrologic alteration was created by selecting flow metrics based on their importance for predicting biological response variables in boosted regression tree models. Metrics were selected in the order of decreasing importance, and no more than two metrics per metric class were selected (i.e. duration, frequency, magnitude, timing and variability). Seven metrics were selected: HighDur (duration of high-flow events), HighNum (\# of high-flow events), NoDisturb (duration between high- or low-flow events), MaxMonthQ (maximum monthly discharge), Q99 (99th percentile of daily streamflow), Qmax                     IDR                     (interdecile range of annual maxima) and                     RBI                     (Richards--Baker Index).                                                                        Applying the index to data from a probabilistic survey, 34\% of stream-miles in southern California were estimated to be hydrologically altered. One of four management priorities were assigned to each site based on biological condition and hydrologic status: protection (healthy and unaltered, 52\% of stream-miles), monitoring (healthy but altered 4\%), evaluation of flow management (unhealthy and altered, 30\%) and evaluation of other management (unhealthy but unaltered, 14\%).                                                     Regionally derived biologically based targets for flow alteration allow catchment managers to prioritise activities and conduct screenings for causal assessments across large spatial scales. Furthermore, regional tools pave the way for incorporation of hydrologic management in policies and catchment planning designed to support biological integrity in streams. Development of regional tools should be a priority where hydrologic alteration is pervasive or expected to increase in response to climate change or urbanisation.},

  abstract = {A variety of movements characterize the behavioral plasticity of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in fresh water, including movements of fry from redds, establishment of feeding territories, spawning movements of sexually mature male parr, movement to and from winter habitat, and smolt migration in spring. Smolting is an adaptive specialization for downstream migration, seawater entry, and marine residence. While still in fresh water, smolts become silvery and streamlined, lose their positive rheotaxis and territoriality, and begin schooling. Physiological changes include increased salinity tolerance, olfactory sensitivity, metabolic rate, scope for growth, and altered hemoglobin and visual pigments. Through their impact on the neuroendocrine system, photoperiod and temperature regulate physiological changes, whereas temperature and water flow may initiate migration. Smolt survival is affected by a limited period of readiness (a physiological ``smolt window'') and the timing of seawater entry with environmental conditions such as temperature, food, and predators (an ecological ``smolt window''). Smolt development is adversely affected by acidity, pollutants, and improper rearing conditions, and is often more sensitive than other life stages. Unfortunately, the migration corridor of smolts (mainstems of rivers and estuaries) are the most heavily impacted by pollution, dams, and other anthropogenic activities that may be directly lethal or increase mortality by delaying or inhibiting smolt migration.},

  abstract = {Lotic fish have developed life history strategies adapted to the natural variation in stream flow regimes. The natural timing, duration, and magnitude of flow events has contributed to the diversity, production, and composition of fish assemblages over time. Studies evaluating the role of hydrology in structuring fish assemblages have been more common at the local or regional scale with very few studies conducted at the continental scale. Furthermore, quantitative linkages between natural hydrologic patterns and fish assemblages are rarely used to make predictions of ecological consequences of hydrologic alterations. We ask two questions: (1) what is the relative role of hydrology in structuring fish assemblages at large scales? and (2) can relationships between fish assemblages and natural hydrology be utilized to predict fish assemblage responses to hydrologic disturbance? We developed models to relate fish life histories and reproductive strategies to landscape and hydrologic variables separately and then combined. Models were then used to predict the ecological consequences of altered hydrology due to dam regulation. Although hydrology plays a considerable role in structuring fish assemblages, the performance of models using only hydrologic variables was lower than that of models constructed using landscape variables. Isolating the relative importance of hydrology in structuring fish assemblages at the continental scale is difficult since hydrology is interrelated to many landscape factors. By applying models to damregulated hydrologic data, we observed some consistent predicted responses in fish life history strategies and modes of reproduction. In agreement with existing literature, equilibrium strategists are predicted to increase following dam regulation, whereas opportunistic and periodic species are predicted to decrease. In addition, dam regulation favors the selection of reproductive strategies with extended spawning seasons and preference for stable conditions. Key words: classification frameworks; dams; ecohydrology; environmental flows; fish reproductive strategies; fish traits; flow--ecology relationship; hydrologic alteration.},

  abstract = {Water is a fundamental resource in freshwater ecosystems, and streamflow plays a pivotal role in driving riverine ecology and biodiversity. Ecologically functional flows, managed hydrographs that are meant to reproduce the primary components of the natural hydrograph, are touted as a potential way forward to restore ecological functions of highly modified rivers, while also balancing human water needs. A major challenge in implementing functional flows will be establishing the shape of the managed hydrograph so as to optimize improvements to the ecosystem given the limited resources. Identifying the shape of the flow--biology relationship is thus critical for determining the environmental consequences of flow regulation. In California's Central Valley, studies have found that increased streamflow can improve survival of imperiled juvenile salmon populations during their oceanward migration. These studies have not explored the potential nonlinearities between flow and survival, giving resource managers the difficult task of designing flows intended to help salmon without clear guidance on flow targets. We used an information theoretic approach to analyze migration survival data from 2436 acoustic-tagged juvenile Chinook salmon from studies spanning differing water years (2013--2019) to extract actionable information on the flow--survival relationship. This relationship was best described by a step function, with three flow thresholds that we defined as minimum (4259 cfs), historic mean (10,712 cfs), and high (22,872 cfs). Survival varied by flow threshold: 3.0\% below minimum, 18.9\% between minimum and historic mean, 50.8\% between historic mean and high, and 35.3\% above high. We used these thresholds to design alternative hydrographs over the same years that included an important component of functional flows: spring pulse flows. We compared predicted cohort migration survival between actual and alternative hydrographs. Managed hydrographs with pulse flows that targeted high survival thresholds were predicted to increase annual cohort migration survival by 55--132\% without any additions to the water budget and by 79--330\% with a modest addition to the water budget. These quantitative estimates of the biological consequences of different flow thresholds provide resource managers with critical information for designing functional flow regimes that benefit salmon in California's highly constrained water management arena.},

  abstract = {River flow regimes, controlled by climatic and catchment factors, vary over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. This hydrological dynamism is important in determining the structure and functioning of riverine ecosystems; however, such hydroecological associations remain poorly quantified. This paper explores and models relationships between a suite of flow regime predictors and macroinvertebrate community metrics from 83 rivers in England and Wales. A two-stage analytical approach was employed: (1) classification of 83 river basins based upon the magnitude and shape (form) of their long-term (1980--1999) average annual regime to group basins with similar flow responses; and (2) examination of relationships between a total of 201 flow regime descriptors identified by previous researchers and macroinvertebrate community metrics for the whole data set and long-term flow regime classes over an 11-year period (1990--2000). The classification method highlighted largescale patterns in river flow regimes, identifying five magnitude classes and three shape classes. A west-east trend of flow regime magnitude (high-low) and timing (early-late peak) was displayed across the study area, reflecting climatic gradients and basin controls (e.g. lithology). From the suite of hydrological variables, those associated with the magnitude of the flow regime consistently produced the strongest relationships with macroinvertebrate community metrics for all sites and for the long-term regime composite classes. The results indicate that the classification (subdivision) of rivers into flow regime regions potentially offers a means of increasing predictive capacity and, in turn, better management of fluvial hydrosystems. \# Crown copyright 2006.

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal variability in river flow is a fundamental control on instream habitat structure and riverine ecosystem biodiversity and integrity. However, long-term riverine ecological time-series to test hypotheses about hydrology--ecology interactions in a broader temporal context are rare, and studies spanning multiple rivers are often limited in their temporal coverage to less than five years. To address this research gap, a unique spatio-temporal hydroecological analysis was conducted of long-term instream ecological responses (1990--2000) to river flow regime variability at 83 sites across England and Wales. The results demonstrate clear hydroecological associations at the national scale (all data). In addition, significant differences in ecological response are recorded between three `regions' identified (RM1--3 ) associated with characteristics of the flow regime. The effect of two major supra-seasonal droughts (1990--1992 and 1996--1997) on inter-annual (IA) variability of the LIFE scores is evident with both events showing a gradual decline before and recovery of LIFE scores after the low flow period. The instream community response to high magnitude flow regimes (1994 and 1995) is also apparent, although these associations are less striking. The results demonstrate classification of rivers into flow regime regions offers a way to help unravel complex hydroecological associations. The approach adopted herein could easily be adapted for other geographical locations, where datasets are available. Such work is imperative to understand flow regime--ecology interactions in a longer term, wider spatial context and so assess future hydroecological responses to climate change and anthropogenic modification of riverine ecosystems.

  abstract = {Temporary streams in California and other Mediterranean climate areas are among the aquatic habitats most altered by human actions and by invasions by alien species. They typically support novel ecosystems, defined as ecosystems dominated by new combinations of organisms in highly altered habitats. Although these new ecosystems have many attributes of the ecosystems they replaced, such as native species, they typically contain many new interactions among species. Managers need to recognize this reality to find ways to direct change towards novel ecosystems with desirable features, including native species. The concept of reconciliation ecology is a practical approach to living with the new reality; it includes actively guiding ecosystem change, as illustrated by Putah Creek, Cosumnes River, Eel River and Six Bit Gulch in California. The first three waterways are all highly altered and managed with varying degrees of success to favour desired aquatic species, whereas Six Bit Gulch experiences such extreme conditions that the original ecosystem is still largely intact. The examples illustrate that most aquatic ecosystems in California are so highly altered that attempting to restore them to an earlier condition or stable state is largely not possible. Where more or less intact systems persist, it is usually because extreme environmental conditions restrict both alien invaders and human use in small watersheds. This pattern appears to be fairly typical of streams in Mediterranean climate areas. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

During winter, juvenile coho salmon were most abundant in alcoves and beaver ponds. Because of the apparent strong preference for alcove and beaver pond habitat during winter and the rarity of that habitat in coastal streams, we concluded that if spawning escapement is adequate, the production of wild coho salmon smolts in most coho salmon spawning streams on the Oregon Coast is probably limited by the availability of adequate winter habitat.},

Effects of changes in flow and flow regime on salmonids are therefore highly stagespecific. Successful management requires consideration of stage-specific influences and integration of these effects over the entire life history to predict ultimate impacts on abundance and population viability. The state of science regarding stage-specific influences of flow regime on juvenile salmonids and their habitats, referring specifically to fundamental attributes of natural regimes and to characteristic alterations of these regimes associated with water management, is reviewed. It appears that a key consideration in integrating the stage-specific impacts of flow is the extent to which flow-related losses or gains early in ontogeny can be compensated by increased growth or survival later in juvenile life history. Further, fundamental interactions between flow and water temperature must be incorporated into the robust models ultimately required for science-based management. In the absence of such models and data, the current state of science may be sufficient to target specific aspects of flow regimes that are critical to multiple life-history stages, which can then serve as a basis for interim flow prescriptions and subsequent adaptive management.},

Optimization modelling is used to maximize out-migrating coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from a natal stream and is applied as a case study in California's Shasta River. Restoration activities that alter flow and water temperature conditions are the decision variables in the model and include relocating a major diversion, increasing riparian shading, increasing instream flow, restoring a cool-water spring and removing a dam. A budget constraint limits total restoration expenditures. This approach combines simple fish population modelling with flow and water quality modelling to explore management strategies and aid decision making. Previous fish habitat optimization research typically uses single restoration strategies, usually by altering reservoir releases or modifying outlet structures. Our method enlarges the solution space to more accurately represent extensive and integrated solutions to fish habitat problems. Results indicate that restoration alternatives can be prioritized by fish habitat improvement and restoration cost. For the Shasta River case study, considerable habitat restoration investments were required before fish productivity increased substantially. This exercise illustrates the potential of ecological optimization for highlighting promising restoration approaches and dismissing poor alternatives.

In regions like California with highly seasonal flow patterns and immense interannual variability, a rigorous approach is needed to accurately identify and quantify seasonal flow transitions from the annual flow regime. Drawing on signal processing theory, this study develops a transferable approach to detect the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily streamflow time series using an iterative smoothing, feature detection, and windowing methodology. The approach is shown to accurately identify and characterize seasonal flows across highly variable natural flow regimes in California. A quantitative error assessment validated the accuracy of the approach, finding that inaccuracies in seasonal timing identification did not exceed 10\%, with infrequent exceptions. Results for seasonal timing were also used to highlight the statistically distinct timing found across streams with varying climatic drivers in California. The proposed approach improves understanding of spatial and temporal trends in hydrologic processes and climate conditions across complex landscapes and informs environmental water management efforts by delineating timing of seasonal flows.},

California, despite having high flow and bioassessment data density, has not established relationships between specific elements of the annual hydrograph and biological stream condition. To address this, we spatially and temporally linked USGS gage stations and biological assessment sites in California to identify suitable paired sites for comparisons of streamflow alteration with biological condition at a statewide scale. Flows were assessed using a set of functional flow metrics that provide a comprehensive way to compare alteration and seasonal variation in streamflow across different locations. Biological response was evaluated using the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) and Algal Stream Condition Index (ASCI), which quantify biological conditions by translating benthic invertebrate or algal resources and watershed-scale environmental data into an overall measure of stream health. These indices provide a consistent statewide standard for interpreting bioassessment data, and thus, a means of quantitatively comparing stream conditions throughout the state. The results indicate that indices of biological stream condition were most closely associated with flow alteration in seasonality and timing metrics, such as fall pulse timing, dry-season timing, and wet season timing. Magnitude metrics such as dry-season baseflow, wet season baseflow, and the fall pulse magnitude were also important in influencing biological stream conditions. Development of ecological flow needs in large-scale environmental programs should consider that alteration to any of the seasonal flow components (e.g., dry-season baseflow, fall pulse flow, wet-season baseflow, spring recession flow) may be important in restructuring biological communities.},

To adapt to what the future holds and to manage the impacts of global change, scientists need to predict the expected effects with some confidence and communicate these predictions to policy makers. However, recent reviews found that we currently lack a clear understanding of how predictable ecology is, with views seeing it as mostly unpredictable to potentially predictable, at least over short time frames. However, in applied, ecology-related fields predictions are more commonly formulated and reported, as well as evaluated in hindsight, potentially allowing one to define baselines of predictive proficiency in these fields. We searched the literature for representative case studies in these fields and collected information about modeling approaches, target variables of prediction, predictive proficiency achieved, as well as the availability of data to parameterize predictive models. We find that some fields such as epidemiology achieve high predictive proficiency, but even in the more predictive fields proficiency is evaluated in different ways. Both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are used in most fields, but differences are often small, with no clear superiority of one approach over the other. Data availability is limiting in most fields, with long-term studies being rare and detailed data for parameterizing mechanistic models being in short supply. We suggest that ecologists adopt a more rigorous approach to report and assess predictive proficiency, and embrace the challenges of real world decision making to strengthen the practice of prediction in ecology.},

Regions like the state of California---where highly engineered, geographically interconnected, and inflexible water management systems are predicated on particular spatiotemporal patterns of water availability---are particularly vulnerable to hydroclimate shifts. However, much of the analysis of hydroclimate sensitivity to anthropogenic climate change has focused on gross metrics like annual mean precipitation, which is highly uncertain at the regional scale. This perceived uncertainty has deterred adaptation investments and quantitative integration of climate projection data into regional water management. Here, we assess projected future shifts in the state of California in a range of hydroclimate metrics critical to water management, using data from 10 statistically downscaled global climate model and two emissions scenarios currently used by the state. We find substantial inter-model agreement under both emissions scenarios---and {$>$} 80\% inter-model agreement under the more severe climate change scenario---across metrics that collectively point toward an increasingly volatile, temporally concentrated, and extreme precipitation future for the state. We show, via hydrologic and operations modeling, that accounting for shifts in these more nuanced metrics reduces the projected reliability and sustainability of current water management practices to a greater degree than would be inferred from changes in total annual precipitation alone. These results highlight both the viability and critical importance of incorporating climate change projections quantitatively into water management decisions in California and other regions vulnerable to hydroclimate shifts, and underscore the need to develop integrated climate-hydrologic-operations models and decision-making protocols capable of accounting for all projected hydroclimate shifts.},

Managers striving to sustain these services in the face of changing climate, land uses, and water demands need tools to assess the potential effectiveness of alternative management actions, and often, the resulting tradeoffs between competing objectives. Integrating predictive modeling with monitoring data in an adaptive management framework provides a process by which managers can reduce model uncertainties and thus improve the scientific bases for subsequent decisions. We demonstrate an integration of monitoring data with a dynamic, metapopulation model developed to assess effects of streamflow alteration on fish occupancy in a southeastern US stream system. Although not extensive (collected over three years at nine sites), the monitoring data allowed us to assess and update support for alternative population dynamic models using model probabilities and Bayes rule. We then use the updated model weights to estimate the effects of water withdrawal on stream fish communities and demonstrate how feedback in the form of monitoring data can be used to improve water resource decision making. We conclude that investment in more strategic monitoring, guided by a priori model predictions under alternative hypotheses and an adaptive sampling design, could substantially improve the information available to guide decisionmaking and management for ecosystem services from lotic systems.},

  abstract = {Summary             1. The flow regime is a primary determinant of the structure and function of aquatic and riparian ecosystems for streams and rivers. Hydrologic alteration has impaired riverine ecosystems on a global scale, and the pace and intensity of human development greatly exceeds the ability of scientists to assess the effects on a river-by-river basis. Current scientific understanding of hydrologic controls on riverine ecosystems and experience gained from individual river studies support development of environmental flow standards at the regional scale.             2. This paper presents a consensus view from a group of international scientists on a new framework for assessing environmental flow needs for many streams and rivers simultaneously to foster development and implementation of environmental flow standards at the regional scale. This framework, the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration (ELOHA), is a synthesis of a number of existing hydrologic techniques and environmental flow methods that are currently being used to various degrees and that can support comprehensive regional flow management. The flexible approach allows scientists, water-resource managers and stakeholders to analyse and synthesise available scientific information into ecologically based and socially acceptable goals and standards for management of environmental flows.             3. The ELOHA framework includes the synthesis of existing hydrologic and ecological databases from many rivers within a user-defined region to develop scientifically defensible and empirically testable relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses. These relationships serve as the basis for the societally driven process of developing regional flow standards. This is to be achieved by first using hydrologic modelling to build a `hydrologic foundation' of baseline and current hydrographs for stream and river segments throughout the region. Second, using a set of ecologically relevant flow variables, river segments within the region are classified into a few distinctive flow regime types that are expected to have different ecological characteristics. These river types can be further subclassified according to important geomorphic features that define hydraulic habitat features. Third, the deviation of current-condition flows from baseline-condition flow is determined. Fourth, flow alteration--ecological response relationships are developed for each river type, based on a combination of existing hydroecological literature, expert knowledge and field studies across gradients of hydrologic alteration.             4. Scientific uncertainty will exist in the flow alteration--ecological response relationships, in part because of the confounding of hydrologic alteration with other important environmental determinants of river ecosystem condition (e.g. temperature). Application of the ELOHA framework should therefore occur in a consensus context where stakeholders and decision-makers explicitly evaluate acceptable risk as a balance between the perceived value of the ecological goals, the economic costs involved and the scientific uncertainties in functional relationships between ecological responses and flow alteration.             5. The ELOHA framework also should proceed in an adaptive management context, where collection of monitoring data or targeted field sampling data allows for testing of the proposed flow alteration--ecological response relationships. This empirical validation process allows for a fine-tuning of environmental flow management targets. The ELOHA framework can be used both to guide basic research in hydroecology and to further implementation of more comprehensive environmental flow management of freshwater sustainability on a global scale.},

  abstract = {Summary             1.{\enspace}In an effort to develop quantitative relationships between various kinds of flow alteration and ecological responses, we reviewed 165 papers published over the last four decades, with a focus on more recent papers. Our aim was to determine if general relationships could be drawn from disparate case studies in the literature that might inform environmental flows science and management.             2.{\enspace}For all 165 papers we characterised flow alteration in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change as reported by the individual studies. Ecological responses were characterised according to taxonomic identity (macroinvertebrates, fish, riparian vegetation) and type of response (abundance, diversity, demographic parameters). A `qualitative' or narrative summary of the reported results strongly corroborated previous, less comprehensive, reviews by documenting strong and variable ecological responses to all types of flow alteration. Of the 165 papers, 152 (92\%) reported decreased values for recorded ecological metrics in response to a variety of types of flow alteration, whereas 21 papers (13\%) reported increased values.             3.{\enspace}Fifty-five papers had information suitable for quantitative analysis of ecological response to flow alteration. Seventy per cent of these papers reported on alteration in flow magnitude, yielding a total of 65 data points suitable for analysis. The quantitative analysis provided some insight into the relative sensitivities of different ecological groups to alteration in flow magnitudes, but robust statistical relationships were not supported. Macroinvertebrates showed mixed responses to changes in flow magnitude, with abundance and diversity both increasing and decreasing in response to elevated flows and to reduced flows. Fish abundance, diversity and demographic rates consistently declined in response to both elevated and reduced flow magnitude. Riparian vegetation metrics both increased and decreased in response to reduced peak flows, with increases reflecting mostly enhanced non-woody vegetative cover or encroachment into the stream channel.             4.{\enspace}Our analyses do not support the use of the existing global literature to develop general, transferable quantitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological response; however, they do support the inference that flow alteration is associated with ecological change and that the risk of ecological change increases with increasing magnitude of flow alteration.             5.{\enspace}New sampling programs and analyses that target sites across well-defined gradients of flow alteration are needed to quantify ecological response and develop robust and general flow alteration--ecological response relationships. Similarly, the collection of pre- and post-alteration data for new water development programs would significantly add to our basic understanding of ecological responses to flow alteration.},

The quarterly monitoring data from 2009 to 2013 was used to study the impact of the water level fluctuation on the phytoplankton biomass and taxonomic composition variation in different hydrological phases in Poyang Lake. Bacillariophyta species are generally dominant in Poyang Lake, constituting more than 50\% of the total phytoplankton biomass, except from July 2009 and January 2012. The results that phytoplankton biomass increased gradually from 2009 to 2013, especially after 2012, indicated there is some time lag in the response of phytoplankton biomass to nutrient loading in Poyang Lake. Our results support the hypothesis that water level fluctuation exert great influence on phytoplankton succession and hydrology fluctuations have an indirect impact on a decrease of Cyanophyta biomass with regard to dilution of nutrients (P, N) in Poyang Lake. This study indicates that we should keep the water level changes more or less as they are because ecologically relevant in Poyang Lake.},

  abstract = {Understanding factors influencing survival of Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) is essential to species conservation, because drivers of mortality can vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Although recent studies have evaluated the effects of climate, habitat quality, or resource management (e.g., hatchery operations) on salmonid recruitment and survival, a failure to look at multiple factors simultaneously leaves open questions about the relative importance of different factors. We analyzed the relationship between ten factors and survival (1980--2007) of four populations of salmonids with distinct life histories from two adjacent watersheds (Salmon and Scott rivers) in the Klamath River basin, California. The factors were ocean abundance, ocean harvest, hatchery releases, hatchery returns, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, El Nin{\texttildelow} o Southern Oscillation, snow depth, flow, and watershed disturbance. Permutation tests and linear mixedeffects models tested effects of factors on survival of each taxon. Potential factors affecting survival differed among taxa and between locations. Fall Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha survival trends appeared to be driven partially or entirely by hatchery practices. Trends in three taxa (Salmon River spring Chinook salmon, Scott River fall Chinook salmon; Salmon River summer steelhead trout O. mykiss) were also likely driven by factors subject to climatic forcing (ocean abundance, summer flow). Our findings underscore the importance of multiple factors in simultaneously driving population trends in widespread species such as anadromous salmonids. They also show that the suite of factors may differ among different taxa in the same location as well as among populations of the same taxa in different watersheds. In the Klamath basin, hatchery practices need to be reevaluated to protect wild salmonids.},

White women and people of color remain underrepresented at all levels of academic faculty, including positions of power such as departmental and institutional leadership. While the proportion of women among geoscience faculty has been cataloged previously, new programs and initiatives aimed at improving diversity, focused on institutional factors that affect equity in the geosciences, necessitate an updated study and a new metric for quantifying the biases that result in under-representation. We compile a data set of 2,531 tenured and tenure-track geoscience faculty from 62 universities in the United States to evaluate the proportion of women by rank and discipline. We find that 27\% of faculty are women. The fraction of women in the faculty pool decreases with rank, as women comprise 46\% of assistant professors, 34\% of associate professors, and 19\% of full professors. We quantify the attrition of women in terms of a fractionation factor, which describes the rate of loss of women along the tenure track and allows us to move away from the metaphor of the ``leaky pipeline.'' Efforts to address inequities in institutional culture and biases in promotion and hiring practices over the past few years may provide insight into the recent positive shifts in fractionation factor. Our results suggest a need for 1:1 hiring between men and women to reach gender parity. Due to significant disparities in race, this work is most applicable to white women, and our use of the gender binary does not represent gender diversity in the geosciences.},

We compare three regularization methods for logistic regression: variable selection, lasso, and ridge. They differ in the way model complexity is measured: variable selection uses the number of estimated parameters, the lasso uses the sum of the absolute values of the parameter estimates, and the ridge uses the sum of the squared values of the parameter estimates. We performed a simulation study with environmental data of a real landscape and artificial species occupancy data. We investigated the effect of three factors on relative model performance: (1) the number of parameters (16, 10, 6, 2) in the `true' model that determined the distribution of the artificial species, (2) the prevalence, i.e. the proportion of sites occupied by the species, and (3) the sample size (measured in events per variable, EPV).},

  abstract = {Many river restoration projects are focusing on restoring environmental flow regimes to improve ecosystem health in rivers that have been developed for water supply, hydropower generation, flood control, navigation, and other purposes. In efforts to prevent future ecological damage, water supply planners in some parts of the world are beginning to address the water needs of river ecosystems proactively by reserving some portion of river flows for ecosystem support. These restorative and protective actions require development of scientifically credible estimates of environmental flow needs. This paper describes an adaptive, inter-disciplinary, science-based process for developing environmental flow recommendations. It has been designed for use in a variety of water management activities, including flow restoration projects, and can be tailored according to available time and resources for determining environmental flow needs. The five-step process includes: (1) an orientation meeting; (2) a literature review and summary of existing knowledge about flow-dependent biota and ecological processes of concern; (3) a workshop to develop ecological objectives and initial flow recommendations, and identify key information gaps; (4) implementation of the flow recommendations on a trial basis to test hypotheses and reduce uncertainties; and (5) monitoring system response and conducting further research as warranted. A range of recommended flows are developed for the low flows in each month, high flow pulses throughout the year, and floods with targeted inter-annual frequencies. We describe an application of this process to the Savannah River, in which the resultant flow recommendations were incorporated into a comprehensive river basin planning process conducted by the Corps of Engineers, and used to initiate the adaptive management of Thurmond Dam.

  abstract = {Hydrologic regimes play a major role in determining the biotic composition, structure, and function of aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystems. But human land and water uses are substantially altering hydrologic regimes around the world. Improved quantitative evaluations of human-induced hydrologic changes are needed to advance research on the biotic implications of hydrologic alteration and to support ecosystem management and restoration plans. We propose a method for assessing the degree of hydrologic alteration attributable to human influence within an ecosystem. This method, referred to as the ``Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration,'' is based upon an analysis of hydrologic data available either from existing measurement points within an ecosystem (such as at stream gauges or wells) or model-generated data. We use 32 parameters, organized into five groups, to statistically characterize hydrologic variation within each year. These 32 parameters provide information on ecologically significant features of surface and ground water regimes influencing aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystems. We then assess the hydrologic perturbations associated with activities such as dam operations, flow diversion, groundwater pumping, or intensive land-use conversion by comparing measures of central tendency and dispersion for each parameter between user-defined ``pre-impact'' and ``post-impact'' time frames, generating 64 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. This method is intended for use with other ecosystem metrics in inventories of ecosystem integrity, in planning ecosystem management activities, and in setting and measuring progress toward conservation or restoration goals.           ,              Los reg{\'i}menes hidrol{\'o}gicos juegan un papel importante en la determinaci{\'o}n de la composici{\'o}n de la biota, la estructura y funci{\'o}n de ecosistemas acu{\'a}ticos inundables y riparios.

The objective of this study was to identify relationships between hydrological variables, describing the flow regime, and macrophyte cover, species richness, diversity and community composition in Danish lowland streams.             2. We quantified macrophyte vegetation in 44 Danish streams during summer by cover, species richness and diversity. Flow regime was characterized by 18 non-intercorrelated variables describing magnitude, frequency and duration of low and high flow events, timing or predictability of flow and general flow variability.                            3. We found support in the stepwise multiple regressions analysis for our expectation that macrophyte cover is lowest in streams with high flow variability and highest in streams with long duration of low flow and low flow variability. We found support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis as there were significant quadratic relationships between species richness and diversity as functions of disturbance frequency. There was poor discrimination in a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) analysis of macrophyte community composition between four               twinspan               groups separating streams with different hydrological properties. Moreover, we did not find any relationship between the presence of disturbance-tolerant species and hydrological disturbance, suggesting that plant community composition developed independently of stream hydrology.},

  abstract = {The 2023 Scott River Juvenile Salmonid Outmigrant Study is part of the ongoing work conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Klamath Watershed Program on the Shasta and Scott Rivers in Siskiyou County, California. The Scott River rotary screw trap has been in operation since 2000. One rotary screw trap was operated from February 21 to July 14, 2023, to sample all age classes of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) emigrating from the Scott River. Mark and recapture trials were conducted multiple times per week to determine trap efficiencies and weekly population estimates. Established age-length cutoffs for each species were used to determine the age of the fish captured. In-stream conditions such as flow and water temperature were also monitored. Weekly estimates for the smolt class of all target species were compared to previous results to evaluate multi-year population trends. Additionally, using multi-year seasonal production estimates and Coho Salmon adult returns to the Scott River, adult survival and smolt production estimates were calculated. For the period sampled in 2023, we estimated that a total of 12,540 0+ and 4,014 1+ Coho Salmon; and 26,337 0+, and 8,775 1+ emigrated from the Scott River. Mark-recapture efficiency trials could not be conducted or were not successful for Chinook salmon, and age 2+ and 3+ Steelhead so production estimates were not generated for these species age classes in 2023.},

  abstract = {Quantifying flow of groundwater through streambeds often is difficult due to the complexity of aquifer-scale heterogeneity combined with local-scale hyporheic exchange. We used fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS), seepage meters, and vertical temperature profiling to locate, quantify, and monitor areas of focused groundwater discharge in a geomorphically simple sand-bed stream. This combined approach allowed us to rapidly focus efforts at locations where prodigious amounts of groundwater discharged to the Quashnet River on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, northeastern USA. FO-DTS detected numerous anomalously cold reaches one to several m long that persisted over two summers. Seepage meters positioned upstream, within, and downstream of 7 anomalously cold reaches indicated that rapid groundwater discharge occurred precisely where the bed was cold; median upward seepage was nearly 5 times faster than seepage measured in streambed areas not identified as cold. Vertical temperature profilers deployed next to 8 seepage meters provided diurnal-signal-based seepage estimates that compared remarkably well with seepage-meter values. Regression slope and R2 values both were near 1 for seepage ranging from 0.05 to 3.0 m d21. Temperature-based seepage model accuracy was improved with thermal diffusivity determined locally from diurnal signals. Similar calculations provided values for streambed sediment scour and deposition at subdaily resolution. Seepage was strongly heterogeneous even along a sandbed river that flows over a relatively uniform sand and fine-gravel aquifer. FO-DTS was an efficient method for detecting areas of rapid groundwater discharge, even in a strongly gaining river, that can then be quantified over time with inexpensive streambed thermal methods.},

  abstract = {With the widespread decline and endangerment of freshwater fishes, there is a need to clearly define habitat requirements for effective species management and habitat restoration. Fish biologists often infer habitat requirements on the basis of correlative habitat associations in the wild. This generates descriptive models that predict species presence or abundance at a hierarchy of scales: distributional (macrohabitat) models predict the presence/absence of species at large scales, capacity models predict the abundance at the reach or channel unit scale when a species is present, and microhabitat models predict the distribution of individual fish at smaller spatial scales (e.g., instream habitat suitability curves for velocity, depth, and substrate). However, relationships based on habitat associations in the wild rarely give definitive insight into the absolute requirement for a particular habitat (i.e., necessity of a habitat for the persistence of individuals and populations). The assumption that habitat selection accurately reflects the fitness consequences of habitat use is rarely validated; more rigorous assessment of habitat requirement usually involves manipulative experiments or measurements of fitness (individual growth, survival, or reproductive success) in different habitat types. Bioenergetic habitat models offer a promising mechanistic alternative to correlative habitat suitability models for drift-feeding fish and have the potential to predict habitat-specific growth rates on the basis of swimming costs and energy intake. Once smaller-scale habitat requirements of individuals are well defined, the final step is to determine when and how the requirements of individuals limit populations. Extrapolating smaller-scale habitat requirements to the population level requires either large-scale (ecosystem) manipulations of habitat, adaptive management, or habitat-explicit population models. For species with distinct ontogenic shifts in habitat requirements, the concept of optimal habitat ratios may be useful for identifying limiting habitat factors and defining baselines for habitat restoration. Defining optimal habitat configurations for different species may also provide a basis for predicting how habitat change differentially affects species with contrasting habitat needs.},

Establishing the shape of flow--ecology relationships (i.e. slope, linearity versus nonlinearity) is particularly important to avoid crossing ecological thresholds in water management.                                                     This review focuses on ecological responses to discharge at low summer flows when out-of-stream water demand is often highest, and identifying ecological contexts where nonlinearities are most likely. Most physical attributes (temperature, dissolved oxygen, available habitat) and ecological responses (energy flow, fish survival, recruitment, community structure) show at least some evidence of nonlinear relationships with flow, although assumptions of linearity may be reasonable across limited discharge ranges which may include low flows.                                                     Nonlinearities are most likely in systems that are near existing thresholds (e.g. cold-water transitional fish communities that are close to upper thermal tolerances). The probability of nonlinearities is likely to increase under future landuse and climate change scenarios, particularly in combination with other stressors, such as eutrophication, which may greatly accelerate temperature-related decline in dissolved oxygen under climate warming.                                                     Managers need to anticipate changes in flow--ecology relationships and develop management systems that are robust to change. Field programmes to establish the slope and linearity of local flow--ecology relationships are essential for regional management, but developing generalisable flow--ecology relationships that are transferrable to regions with limited resources also needs to be a priority.                                                     Generalised relationships can be generated through meta-analysis of empirical flow--ecology relationships, and may prove especially useful if they can capture how environmental and ecological context (channel size and morphology, landuse, flow regime, antecedent conditions, habitat or taxonomic guild) affect flow--ecology relationships. For instance, linking empirical data from flow--ecology relationships to available habitat predicted by physical habitat simulation models (e.g. PHABSIM) may provide a better mechanistic basis for modelling ecological responses, while providing much needed validation for habitat simulation approaches. This would also help bridge the gap between emerging holistic environmental flow modelling approaches and more traditional habitat simulation methods.},

  title = {Developing Generalized Flow Ecology Relationships for Stream Salmonids: {{Providing}} a Clearer Empirical Basis for Minimum Flow RegulationÔªøs},
  author = {Rosenfeld, Jordan S and Enright, Daniel},
  abstract = {Objective: To provide a clearer empirical basis for guiding minimum flow regulations, we tested for a consistent relationship between the magnitude of stable flows and correlates of productive capacity for stream salmonids. Methods: We extracted and analyzed data from 35 flow--ecology relationships related to salmonid productive capacity (defined by diverse ecological responses including abundance, density, growth, or survival) from 25 streams ranging in flow from 0.4 to 750 m3/s mean annual discharge (MAD). To facilitate comparison among studies, we rescaled flow to percentage of MAD and rescaled ecological responses to a 0--1 range (dividing by the largest value in each study) or units of standard deviation (dividing by the SD). To control for effects of season and flow regime, we classified studies into four common hydroecological contexts: summer low flows (rainfall dominant streams with dry summers), summer high flows (snowmelt/glacial runoff streams), winter low flows, and migration or spawning flows. Standardized ecological response was then modeled as a function of percent MAD, ecological context, and their interaction. Results: The slope of ecological response--flow relationships was positive for summer or winter low-flow regimes and migration flows but negative in summer high-flow regimes, consistent with expectations from habitat simulation models of a unimodal relationship between flow and habitat availability. Generalized additive models and logistic regression indicated peak salmonid productive capacity at 57\% MAD (approximate 95\% CIs 39--93\% MAD), and average low-flow regressions indicate an 82\% loss of capacity from 57\% MAD (optimal flow) to flow cessation (0\% MAD). Conclusions: Standardizing response and flow axes while controlling for context dependence (i.e., seasonal hydrology) provides a useful approach for extracting cryptic flow--ecology relationships from diverse data sets, allowing detection of generalized flow--ecology relationships with optimal rearing flows at intermediate discharge. These generic relationships can be used to predict population-average flow effects in data-deficient salmonid streams and guide landscape-level flow policy.},

  abstract = {The Pajaro River, central coastal California, consistently loses 0.2--0.4 m3/s of discharge along an 11.42-km experimental reach late in the water year, when discharge is 64.5 m3/s. Channel loss occurs throughout this reach, but is greatest in magnitude near the bottom of the reach. Water isotopic data and other observations suggest that channel loss results mainly from streambed seepage, as opposed to evapotranspiration. If it occurs throughout the year, the channel loss along this short stream reach could contribute 6--13 {$\cdot$} 106 m3 of annual aquifer recharge, or 20--40\% of current sustainable basin yield. We performed a series of tracer injections along this reach to determine if hydrologic exchange occurs within this strongly-losing stream. We found that during periods of high channel loss, there were also comparable storage exchange fluxes and lateral inflow of tracer-free water. Within upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, storage exchange fluxes are about 10 times greater than lateral inflow. The former are associated with the movement of water between the main channel and surface or subsurface storage zones. In this system, it is likely that the latter are primarily associated with spatially- or temporally-long subsurface flow paths within the shallow streambed, as opposed to inflow of ground water from deeper in the basin. Along both upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, lateral inflow tends to increase as channel discharge decreases. In contrast, storage exchange fluxes increase with decreasing discharge along the upper parts of the reach, but decrease with decreasing discharge along the lower parts. Gauging and tracer test results suggest that subsurface storage exchange and loss may occur c 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We present a novel spatially distributed analysis of ecohydrological interactions in the semi-arid Colorado River Basin (CRB) over 18 years, 2001--2019. The hydrologic predictors used include precipitation from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM, 0- to 10-cmdepth surface soil moisture (SSM) estimations from the National Land Data Assimilation System, and newly available 0- to 40-cm depth Soil MERGE root zone soil moisture (RZSM) estimations.

We demonstrate that EVI response is strongest and most immediate to the hydrologic predictors in the hot and dry southwestern CRB, with lag times of 0--32 days. RZSM was expected to provide the best predictor of EVI, but we found SSM to be a superior predictor of EVI with interquartile range correlations of 0.20--0.37 across the CRB. RZSM had slightly lower interquartile range correlations of 0.15--0.35, and precipitation was the least effective predictor of EVI with interquartile range correlations of 0.11--0.26.

  abstract = {Quantifying groundwater discharge remains a challenge due to its large temporal and spatial variability. Here, we quantify groundwater discharge into a small estuary using radon (222Rn) and radium isotopes (223Ra and 224Ra). High temporal resolution (30 min time steps) radon observations at 4 time series stations were used to determine where groundwater discharge is prevalent in the estuary, and to reduce mass balance model uncertainties. A three-endmember mixing model was developed based on short-lived radium isotopes (sampled at a single location) to separate the shallow saline and deep fresh sources of the discharging groundwater. The results show that using multiple 222Rn time series stations decreased the overall uncertainty of groundwater discharge estimates from about 41\% to 23\%. The radon derived groundwater flux was 56 {\textpm} 13 and 35 {\textpm} 12 cm d 1 in wet and dry conditions, respectively. The spatially distributed stations detected a well-defined small area located four kilometers upstream from the mouth of the estuary as a groundwater discharging hotspot. Estimates based on a 223Ra and 224Ra mass balance resulted in groundwater discharge estimates of 65 {\textpm} 18 and 84 {\textpm} 48 cm d 1 in the wet and 18 {\textpm} 5 and 20 {\textpm} 6 cm d 1 in the dry. The mixing model revealed contrasting results for deep vs. fresh groundwater contribution in wet and dry conditions. In wet conditions, deep fresh groundwater discharging into the estuary contributed 65\% compared to the shallow saline groundwater (35\%), while during dry conditions a larger contribution (80\%) was related to shallow groundwater. A comprehensive spatial and temporal sampling strategy can produce groundwater discharge estimates with lower uncertainty and provides additional insight on where groundwater enters surface waters.},

A common form of available data for a PVA is population counts through time. Previous research has suggested that improving estimates of population trends and risk from count data depends on longer observation periods, but that is often impractical or undesirable. Making multiple observations within a single time step is an alternative way to gather more data without extending the observation period. In this paper, we examine the trade-off between the length of the time period over which observations of the population have been taken and the total number of observations or samples that have been recorded through an analysis of simulated data. We found that when the ratio of process error to measurement error variance is high, more precise estimates of quasi-extinction risks can be obtained if replicated observations are taken at each time step, but when the ratio is low, replicated observations add little benefit in improving precision. These results can be used to efficiently design effective monitoring schemes for species of conservation concern.},

During a severe California drought in 2013--2014, storage in a strategic reservoir dropped to critically low levels, necessitating reduced downstream discharge during Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), incubation and rearing. In response, stakeholders developed an adaptive management process to balance competing water needs, including reservoir storage and salmon survival. This approach incorporated decision tree models, integrating salmon life stage transitions to define potential impacts. Life stage-specific thresholds were identified and monitored to determine management triggers and actions. Flow reduction stranded up to 12\% of incubating embryos and thus was used to trigger a flow pulse. Frequency of stranded fry in redds was reduced post-pulse. Water quality did not change but remained within the species' tolerance. High densities, poor body condition and aggressive behaviour of stranded fry triggered a second pulse three weeks later. This pulse reduced stranding and initiated downstream migration. Prescribed flow pulses supported outmigration of a keystone species while minimising water use during a critical period. This study evaluated ecological responses to management actions intended to ameliorate stressful low flow conditions and provided a decision-making framework that can be used when resource use conflicts arise again.},

Trend analyses were applied to indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHAs) at 34 streamgages over a 50-year period (1962--2012). Results showed a significant negative trend in annual streamflow for 10 of 12 western streamgages (up to -7.65 mm/50 years) and smaller negative trends for most other streamgages. Significant negative trends in western basin streamflow were more widespread in summer (12 stations) than in winter or spring (6 stations). The negative-trend magnitude and significance decreased from west to east for maximum-flow IHAs. Minimum-flow IHAs, however, significantly decreased at High Plains streamgages but significantly increased at Central Great Plains streamgages. Number of zero-flow days showed positive trends in the High Plains. Most streamgages showed negative trends in low- and high-flow pulse frequency and high-flow pulse duration, and positive trends in low-flow pulse duration. These results were consistent with increasing occurrence of drought. Shift in occurrence from present (1860--1950) to absent (2000--2012) was significantly related (p {$<$} .10) to negative trends of 1-day maximum flows (both species) and indices associated with reduced spawning-season flows for Plains Minnow and shifting annual-flow timing and increased flow intermittency for Common Shiner. Both species were absent for all western basin sites and had different responses to hydrological index trends at eastern basin sites. These results demonstrate ecohydrological index changes impact distributions of native fish and suggest target factors for assessment or restoration activities.},

These relationships can be specific for different natural flow regime types. The object of our study is testing the ELOHA method in the Ebro River Basin. Seven flow alteration--ecological response curves were obtained in the present study as preliminary guidelines for developing and calibrating environmental flow standards in the Ebro River Basin. For continental Mediterranean-pluvial flow regime mean monthly flow in March was related to Plecoptera abundance (ELOHAs {\textpm}21\% from baseline), and high flow magnitude and frequency were closely related to Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera richness (ELOHAs for high flow magnitude and frequency were +18 and +54\% the reference central value respectively). For nivo-pluvial flow regime, high flow magnitude was found indicative of macroinvertebrate biodiversity and Coleoptera abundance (ELOHAS 12 and +23\% from central reference value respectively). And for pluvio-oceanic flow regime, mean monthly flow in January was indicative of the proportion of Gastropoda, Oligochaeta and Diptera taxa (GOLD index) (ELOHA +17\% from baseline). These hydrological limits are endorsed by recent international reference works. Flow alteration--ecological relationships presented here were constructed from real monthly flow data records and macroinvertebrate samples at family level. ELOHA values obtained in this study pretend to be a starting point for implementing an environmental flow regime program in the Ebro River Basin.

  abstract = {Environmental flow programs aim to protect aquatic habitats and species while recognizing competing water demands. Often this is done at the local or watershed level because it is relatively easier to address technical and implementation challenges at these scales. However, a consequence of this approach is that ecological flow criteria are developed for only a few areas as dictated by funding and interest with many streams neglected. Here we discuss the collaborative development of the California Environmental Flows Framework (CEFF) as an example process for developing environmental flow recommendations at a statewide scale. CEFF uses a functional flows approach, which focuses on protecting a broad suite of ecological, geomorphic, and biogeochemical functions instead of specific species or habitats, and can be applied consistently across diverse stream types and spatial scales. CEFF adopts a tiered approach in which statewide models are used to estimate               ecological flow needs               based on natural functional flow ranges, i.e., metrics that quantify the required magnitude, timing, duration, frequency, and/or rate-of-change of functional flow components under reference hydrologic conditions, for every stream reach in the state. Initial flow needs can then be revised at regional, or watershed, scales based on local constraints, management objectives, and available data and resources. The third tier of CEFF provides a process for considering non-ecological flow needs to produce a final set of               environmental flow recommendations               that aim to balance of all desired water uses. CEFF was developed via a broad inclusive process that included technical experts across multiple disciplines, representatives from federal and state agencies, and stakeholders and potential end-users from across the state. The resulting framework is therefore not associated with any single agency or regulatory program but can be applied under different contexts, mandates and end-user priorities. The inclusive development of CEFF also allowed us to achieve consensus on the technical foundations and commitment to applying this approach in the future.},

A Bayesian hierarchical model which accounted for {$>$}80\% of variation in abundances for all species and age classes (               i.e               . juvenile and adult), identified the extent to which the influence of short-term flow variation was dependent upon the historical flow regime.

This is especially true for irrigated agricultural basins with a strong connection between land use, groundwater, and surface water. Using a range rather than a single set of initial parameter values, multiple sensitivity analyses, calibrations, and linearity tests were performed using UCODE\_2014 on the Scott Valley Integrated Hydrologic Model. Calibration results show that parameters related to crop demand and applied irrigation water are most sensitive. Influence statistics show that low streamflow observations provide the most information during model calibration, indicating preference should be given to these observations during model development, sensitivity analysis, and calibration. Importantly, due to the nonlinearity of the integrated model, significant differences are found in results when initial parameter values are sampled from within their respective expected ranges. Estimates for some parameters varied up to an order of magnitude between calibrations, while all produced similar final objective function values, groundwater elevations, and stream flow. Confidence intervals for individual sensitivity analyses and calibration runs only spanned a fraction of the ensemble estimated parameter range across multiple runs. Our work suggests that a calibration design with multiple sensitivity analyses and calibrations of integrated hydrologic models, each using one of several widely varying sets of initial values, provides a frugal approach to identify parameters across the global parameter space.},

However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

  abstract = {This article tests the association between streamflow alteration and the alteration of ecologically significant hydraulic environments. There has been a recent shift in environmental flow assessments to develop rapid desktop-based approaches that are applicable in a regional context. Streamflow statistics (e.g. minimum monthly flow) are often chosen to predict the impact of streamflow alteration on aquatic ecosystems. The assumption that the flow--biota relationship will be obscured by the effect of how streamflow interacts with channel morphology is often acknowledged, but not quantified. In this study, streamflow statistics are derived for 19 reaches in four river systems in Victoria, Australia. Hydraulic metrics were used to quantify ecologically significant surface flow conditions (Froude number) and the area of bench inundation, shallow and deep water. Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the correlation between streamflow statistics altered with regulation and the hydraulic metrics. It was found that streamflow statistics have a weak correlation to surface flow condition and the area of shallow water under natural streamflow conditions. The results show that hydrologic statistics have limited utility in quantifying changes in hydraulic environments. A similar magnitude of flow alteration can produce diverse hydraulic results. The confounding influence of channel morphology prevents streamflow statistics being an adequate surrogate for the assessment of hydraulic alteration. Modelling flow--biota relationships in a regional context is limited by the inadequacy of streamflow statistics to model ecologically significant hydraulic function. Improving knowledge of ecohydraulically significant hydrologic statistics will improve the effectiveness of environmental flow planning to sustain instream habitat conditions. A probabilistic approach is required to enable a risk-based approach to desktop generalization of flow--biota relations.},

Climate has been proposed as the primary cause of base-flow decline in the Scott River, an important coho salmon rearing tributary in the Klamath Basin. We took a comparative-basin approach to estimating the relative contributions of climatic and non-climatic factors to this decline. We used permutation tests to compare discharge in 5 streams and 16 snow courses between ``historic'' (1942-1976) and ``modern'' (1977-2005) time periods, defined by cool and warm phases, respectively, of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. April 1 SWE decreased significantly at most snow courses lower than 1,800 m in elevation and increased slightly at higher elevations. Correspondingly, base flow decreased significantly in the two streams with the lowest latitude-adjusted elevation and increased slightly in two higher-elevation streams. Base-flow decline in the Scott River, the only study stream heavily utilized for irrigation, was larger than that in all other streams and larger than predicted by elevation. Based on comparison with a neighboring stream draining wilderness, we estimate that 39\% of the observed 10 Mm3 decline in July 1-October 22 discharge in the Scott River is explained by regional-scale climatic factors. The remainder of the decline is attributable to local factors, which include an increase in irrigation withdrawal from 48 to 103 Mm3 {\textfractionsolidus} year since the 1950s.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Forecasting the recruitment of fish populations with skill has been a challenge in fisheries for over a century. Previous large-scale meta-analyses have suggested linkages between environmental or ecosystem drivers and recruitment; however, applying this information in a management setting remains underutilized. Here, we use a well-studied database of groundfish assessments from the West Coast of the USA to ask whether environmental variables or ecosystem indicators derived from long-term monitoring datasets offer an improvement in our ability to skilfully forecast fish recruitment. A secondary question is which types of modelling approaches (ranging from linear models to non-parametric methods) yield the best forecast skill. Third, we examine whether simultaneous forecasting of multiple species offers an advantage over generating species-specific forecasts. We find that for approximately one third of the 29 assessed stocks, ecosystem indicators from juvenile surveys yields the highest out of sample predictive skill compared to other covariates (including environmental variables from Regional Ocean Modeling System output) or null models. Across modelling approaches, our results suggest that simpler linear modelling approaches do as well or better than more complicated approaches (reducing out of sample Root Mean Square Error by {\textasciitilde}40\% compared to null models), and that there appears to be little benefit to performing multispecies forecasts instead of single-species forecasts. Our results provide a general framework for generating recruitment forecasts in other species and ecosystems, as well as a benchmark for future analyses to evaluate skill. The most promising applications are likely for species that are short lived, have relatively high recruitment variability, and moderate amounts of age or length data. Forecasts using our approach may be useful in identifying covariates or mechanisms to include in operational assessments but also provide qualitative advice to managers implementing ecosystem based fisheries management.},

  abstract = {We collated smolt-to-adult return rate (SAR) data for Chinook salmon from all available regions of the Pacific coast of North America to examine the large-scale patterns of salmon survival. For consistency, our analyses primarily used coded wire tag-based (CWT) SAR estimates. Survival collapsed over the past half century by roughly a factor of three to ca. 1\% for many regions. Within the Columbia River, the SARs of Snake River populations, often singled out as exemplars of poor survival, are unexceptional and in fact higher than estimates reported from many other regions of the west coast lacking dams. Given the seemingly congruent decline in SARs to similar levels, the notion that contemporary survival is driven primarily by broader oceanic factors rather than local factors should be considered. Ambitious Columbia River rebuilding targets may be unachievable because other regions with nearly pristine freshwater conditions, such as SE Alaska and northern BC, also largely fail to reach these levels. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag-based SAR estimates available for Columbia River Basin populations are generally consistent with CWT findings; however, PIT tag-based SARs are not adjusted for harvest which compromises their intended use because harvest rates are large and variable. More attention is needed on how SARs should be quantified and how rebuilding targets are defined. We call for a systematic review by funding agencies to assess consistency and comparability of the SAR data generated and to further assess the implications of survival falling to similar levels in most regions of the west coast.},

Methods used to generate flow-ecology relationships can be thought of as a continuum bookended by pure states approaches on one end and by rates approaches on the other. In pure states approaches, the ecological response is a snapshot of a condition or property (i.e. a state) derived from a single measurement in time. In contrast, ecological responses in rates approaches reflect temporal change (i.e. a rate) and are thus reliant on repeated measurements made over time.                                                     Here, we elaborate on the fundamental characteristics of different approaches (pure states, rates and an intermediate approach we call repeated states) for generating flow-ecology relationships, examine how commonly the different approaches are used in the flow-ecology literature, conduct an independent analysis to illustrate the different outcomes achieved by applying repeated-states and rates approaches using a dataset for stream fish diversity in relation to flow magnitude, and identify some of the different ways ecologists are applying rates approaches in flow ecology.                                                     Our literature review revealed that repeated-states approaches (53\% of reviewed studies) were used far more commonly than either pure states (19\%) or rates (12\%) approaches to generate flow-ecology relationships. The remaining hybrid studies (17\%) used both state and rate responses, and thus also relied on repeated measurements over time.                                                     Despite frequent collection of data suitable for rates approaches, flow-ecology relationships have generally been developed using states approaches that relate changes in ecological states to different long-term average flow conditions, rather than to specific flow sequences over much shorter time intervals. Such flow-ecology relationships cannot generate temporally specific predictions of ecological responses to changing flow conditions (i.e. the expected change in state following a specific flow sequence), nor can they describe demographic processes underlying observed changes. While there are different scenarios in which a pure or repeated-states approach would be useful, more frequent use of rates approaches would increase our ability to test flow-ecology hypotheses and our mechanistic understanding of flow-ecology relationships.},

Water transactions are becoming an increasingly used approach to provide instream flows during periods when there are competing water uses. Water transactions are often used to achieve ecological objectives, but their water quality or biological effects are rarely quantified. The effects of a water transaction implemented in the Shasta River were evaluated by using a spreadsheet model to quantify changes in dissolved oxygen conditions as they relate to discharge, pool volumes, holding habitat capacity, and potential dissolved oxygen demand by holding fish. The results indicate that water transactions may mitigate potential water quality impairments by decreasing the residence time in holding habitat, and are particularly effective during periods when flows are low, holding habitats are near carrying capacity, and dissolved oxygen demand by fish is elevated.

  abstract = {River regulation patterns play a key role in ecohydrology and they directly affect hydrodynamic variables, fish habitats, and fish abundance conditions. In the Kraal River, the Trunk Dam is currently being constructed and very little is known about the dam construction and operation impacts on fish species. In this study, an ecohydraulic model was built and linked to hydromorpho-dynamic, fish habitat, and fish abundance simulations. Two fish species, schizothorax (Schizothorax) and schizothorax (Racoma), representing a main and an endangered fish species, respectively of the Kraal River, were studied; their habitats and abundance statuses were predicted and analyzed based on four different long-term dam operation scenarios. Fish-friendly river regulation scenarios were also examined. The temporal- and spatial-scale hydro-morphodynamic results indicate that the erosion effects are much more significant than the deposition effects. Our study suggests that habitat destruction and fragmentation existed for all presented river regulation scenarios. The analysis indicates that long-term river regulation will result in a decrease in the fish population. However, there will be different levels of decline for fish habitats and populations depending on the dam operation scenarios. This study contributes to a better understanding of the dam-induced temporal habitat fragmentation and response of fish communities. This study also provides quantitative evidence for suitable river regulation scenarios and fish stocking strategies, which can help the fish community recover to a stable level.},

The approach focuses on retaining specific process-based components of the hydrograph, or functional flows, rather than attempting to mimic the full natural flow regime. Key functional components include wet-season initiation flows, peak magnitude flows, recession flows, dry-season low flows, and interannual variability. We illustrate the importance of each key functional flow using examples from western US rivers with seasonably predictable flow regimes. To maximize the functionality of these flows, connectivity to morphologically diverse overbank areas must be enhanced in both space and time, and consideration must be given to the sediment-transport regime. Finally, we provide guiding principles for developing functional flows or incorporating functional flows into existing environmental flow frameworks.},

  abstract = {The science and practice of environmental flows have advanced significantly over the last several decades. Most environmental flow approaches require quantifying the relationships between hydrologic change and biologic response, but this can be challenging to determine and implement due to high data requirements, limited transferability, and the abundance of hydrologic metrics available for evaluation. We suggest that a functional flows approach, focusing on elements of the natural flow regime known to sustain important ecosystem processes, offers a pathway for linking understanding of ecosystem processes with discrete, quantifiable measures of the flow regime for a broad range of native taxa and assemblages. Functional flow components can be identified as distinct aspects of the annual hydrograph that support key biophysical processes, such as wet season flood flows or spring recession flows, and then quantified by flow metrics, such as 5\% exceedance flow or daily percent decrease in flow, respectively. By selecting a discrete set of flow metrics that measure key functional flow components, the spatial and temporal complexity of flow regimes can be managed in a holistic manner supportive of multiple ecological processes and native aquatic species requirements. We provide an overview of the functional flows approach to selecting a defined set of flow metrics and illustrate its application in two seasonally variable stream systems. We further discuss how a functional flows approach can be utilized as a conceptual model both within and outside of existing environmental flow frameworks to guide consideration of ecological processes when designing prescribed flow regimes.},

  abstract = {The paired catchment approach has been the predominant method for detecting the effects of disturbance on catchment-scale hydrology. Notwithstanding, the utility of this approach is limited by regression model sample size, variability between paired catchments, type II error, and the inability of locating a long-term suitable control. An increasingly common practice is to use rainfall-runoff models to discern the effect of disturbance on hydrology, but few hydrologic model studies (1) consider problems associated with model identification, (2) use formal statistical methods to evaluate the significance of hydrologic change relative to variations in rainfall and streamflow, and (3) apply change detection models to undisturbed catchments to test the approach. We present an alternative method to the paired catchment approach and improve on stand-alone hydrologic modeling to discern the effects of forest harvesting at the catchment scale. Our method combines rainfall-runoff modeling to account for natural fluctuations in daily streamflow, uncertainty analyses using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method to identify and separate hydrologic model uncertainty from unexplained variation, and GLS regression change detection models to provide a formal experimental framework for detecting changes in daily streamflow relative to variations in daily hydrologic and climatic data. We include statistical analyses of climate variation and a two-part evaluation to explore model performance and account for unexplained variation. Evaluations consisted of applying our method to a control catchment and to a period prior to harvesting in a treated catchment to demonstrate that our method was capable of capturing the absence of land use change in an undisturbed catchment and capturing the absence of land use change during a period of no disturbance in the harvested catchment. In addition, we explore the sensitivity of our method to model identification, number of simulations, and likelihood thresholds for model identification. We show that an increase in the number of model simulations does not necessarily result in increased change detection performance. Our method is a potentially useful alternative to the paired catchment approach where reference catchments are not possible and to stand-alone hydrologic modeling for detecting the effects of land use change on hydrology.},
