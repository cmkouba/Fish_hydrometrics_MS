  abstract = {The term ``environmental flows'' describes the quantities, quality, and patterns of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. Environmental flows may be achieved in a number of different ways, most of which are based on either (1) limiting alterations from the natural flow baseline to maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity or (2) designing flow regimes to achieve specific ecological and ecosystem service outcomes. We argue that the former practice is more applicable to natural and semi-natural rivers where the primary objective and opportunity is ecological conservation. The latter ``designer'' approach is better suited to modified and managed rivers where return to natural conditions is no longer feasible and the objective is to maximize natural capital as well as support economic growth, recreation, or cultural history. This permits elements of ecosystem design and adaptation to environmental change. In a future characterized by altered climates and intensive regulation, where hybrid and novel aquatic ecosystems predominate, the designer approach may be the only feasible option. This conclusion stems from a lack of natural ecosystems from which to draw analogs and the need to support broader socioeconomic benefits and valuable configurations of natural and social capital.},

  abstract = {Temporary streams and rivers, also referred to as intermittent, are defined as waterways that cease to flow at some points in space and time along their course. They are shaped by alternating wet and dry periods over annual and inter-annual cycles, making them one of the most dynamic freshwater ecosystems. These distinctive systems represent a substantial proportion of the total number, length and discharge of the global river network and are expected to become more widespread and face increasing pressures in many regions as a result of human activities and climate change. This collection of papers arose from the Conference on `Ecohydrology and Ecological Quality in Temporary Rivers' held at the University of Evora, Portugal, 12--14 September 2012. The primary objectives of the meeting were to bring together researchers and expertise from a range of temporary ecosystems, from small temporary Mediterranean and Californian streams to intermittent rivers from semi-arid and arid zones. A common thread through the discussions was the assessment of ecological conditions within these dynamic ecosystems. To undertake a 'condition assessment' is challenging because of the need to differentiate between biotic responses to anthropogenic pressures and natural variability associated with the hydro-climatology and disturbance regime typical of these systems, that is, drought, drying and flooding. The management of degraded intermittent streams and rivers presents many new challenges, not least how to reconcile ecological and societal goals for emerging `novel' ecosystems. Reconciliation ecology presents a realistic way of managing novel ecosystems given their value and desirable ecological services to society, rather than trying to restore to an original ecological state that may not be sustainable or economically possible.

  abstract = {Abstract             Streamflow regimes that maintain vital functions and processes of aquatic ecosystems are critical to sustaining ecosystem health. In rivers with altered flow regimes, restoring components of the natural flow regime is predicted to conserve freshwater biodiversity by supporting ecological functions and geomorphological processes to which native communities are adapted. However, the effectiveness of environmental flow restoration is poorly understood because of inadequate monitoring and uncertainty in ecological responses to managed changes in specific, quantifiable aspects of the annual streamflow regime. Here, we used time series models to analyze 25\,years of fish assemblage data collected before and after environmental flow implementation in a dammed river in California, USA. We examined the response of the fish community to changes in individual components of the flow regime known to support ecosystem functions. We found that as functional flow components shifted toward their predicted natural range, the quasi-extinction risk (likelihood of population declines of {$>$}80\%) decreased for the native fish assemblage. Following environmental flow implementation, observed changes toward natural ranges of dry season duration, fall pulse flow magnitude, and wet season timing each reduced quasi-extinction risk by at least 40\% for the native assemblage. However, functional flow components that shifted away from their predicted natural range, including lower spring recession flows and higher dry season baseflow, resulted in greater quasi-extinction risk for native species. In contrast, non-native species decreased in abundance when flow components shifted toward predicted natural ranges and increased when components shifted away from their natural range. Although most functional flow components remained outside of their natural range following environmental flow implementation, our results indicate that even moderate shifts toward a natural flow regime can benefit native and suppress non-native fish species. Overall, this study provides the most compelling evidence to date of the effectiveness of functional environmental flows in supporting native fish recovery in a highly regulated river.},

We illustrate this framework with a case study, whereby fish community responses to various water-management scenarios were predicted in a partially regulated river system at a local watershed scale. This case study simulates management scenarios based on interactive effects of dam operation protocols, withdrawals for municipal water supply, effluent discharges from wastewater treatment, and inter-basin water transfers. Modeled streamflow was integrated with flow--ecology relationships relating hydrologic departure from reference conditions to fish species richness, stratified by trophic, reproductive, and habitat characteristics. Adding a hypothetical new water-withdrawal site was predicted to increase the frequency of low-flow conditions with adverse effects for several fish groups. Imposition of new reservoir release requirements was predicted to enhance flow and fish species richness immediately downstream of the reservoir, but these effects were dissipated further downstream. The framework presented here can be used to translate flow--ecology relationships into evidence-based management by developing decision-support systems for conservation of riverine biodiversity while optimizing water availability for human use.},

However, these frameworks largely focus on identifying suitable flows and often ignore the important links between management actions, resulting flows, and valued ecosystem or social responses. Structured decision making (SDM) could assist the comparison of environmental flows by providing a mature framework to link management actions to objectives via environmental flow science. We describe SDM and illustrate its application using a case study focused on comparing environmental flow scenarios for the mainstem Willamette River, Oregon. In a short timeframe, SDM was applied to identify objectives, develop empirical and expert opinion-based models, and compare flow scenarios while accounting for interannual flow variability and partial controllability. No scenario was clearly preferred based on available knowledge, largely because river flows could only be partially controlled through dam operations. Participants agreed that SDM was useful for comparing alternative dam operations, but that refined predictive models and additional objectives were needed to better inform basinwide flow decisions. In our view, SDM can provide more realistic comparisons of environmental flows by accounting for partial controllability and uncertainty, which may result in greater implementation of available flow management actions.},

We searched the literature from 1945 to 2020, including articles on positive deviance or positive outliers, and restricted to examining individual rather than organizational outcomes. We analyzed the methodology applied including the process of identifying deviants, the use of control groups, and the degree of community engagement. Results: Our initial search identified 1140 manuscripts; we included 104 papers describing 98 studies, 11 topical and one miscellaneous category. Most studies used objective measures of health or survey-based responses to identify deviants from a sub-set of the population at risk. The use of controls was less common in some topics (hospital infections), whereas controls were universally applied in other topics (malnutrition). The degree of community engagement varied widely. Conclusions: Positive deviance would benefit from improvements in reporting and standardized approaches to defining deviance. Studies could be improved through clarified definitions of deviance/risk, explicit descriptions of community engagement, and more consistent use of controls.},

  abstract = {Macroinvertebrates' response to hydromorphological alterations and regulated flows along lowland rivers is still poorly known despite ecohydrology's fundamental role in river science. Along the Oglio River (Northern Italy), several water abstractions and dams break it into segments with varying hydraulic and morphological properties. Three types of a priori different environments were identified (dammed, downstream and free flowing sections), and macroinvertebrate communities were sampled from each zone. This study aimed (i) to investigate patterns of macroinvertebrate communities along a regulated lowland river by testing the a priori zones; (ii) to find macroinvertebrate taxa that served as indicators of the various hydrological conditions and (iii) to verify hydromorphological control over ecological macroinvertebrate traits resulting in different trait values in each identified zone. Macroinvertebrate community was characterized in a total of 63 stations by means of two quantitative approaches, each exploring a surface of 0.5 m2. The lowest richness values were found in dammed sites that tended toward lentic conditions. Ecnomidae (dammed zones), Limoniidae (downstream zones) and Heptageniidae (free flowing section) were identified as the best indicators of varying hydrological conditions. As suggested by the results of 4th Corner Method, environmental constraints define communities with different ecological traits. These results highlight hydromorphological control over macroinvertebrate community structure and reflect how regulated flows affect the Oglio River in terms of biodiversity, indicator taxa and ecological traits. The authors wish to stress the importance of considering the ecological effects of dams and impoundments on river systems in upstream areas as well as downstream.

However, assessments of these impacts on the freshwater fish distribution are still scarce. We investigated whether an artificial flow regime generated by discharges from an aqueduct would promote a longitudinal environmental gradient in an off-river reservoir. We tested the hypothesis that the incoming water from aqueduct discharges promotes environmental gradient between lotic and lentic conditions. We expect that environmental changes and the artificial flow regime promote the structuring of fish assemblage and that the lotic-lentic transition areas present the highest fish species richness. A longitudinal gradient in environmental characteristics with differing fish assemblage structure was found. Temporal changes in the fish assemblages occurred only in areas near the discharge of the aqueduct. The highest fish richness and diversity were recorded in the transition zone during the wet season, associated with the greater environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone, whereas the lowest was found in the lotic zone, probably associated with the altered flow regime. The greatest abundance was recorded in the upper lentic zone in the wet season, whereas the lowest was found in the lower lentic zone in both seasons. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that the artificial flow regime, modulated by the seasonality of discharges and the influence of environmental variables, promotes longitudinal gradients in reservoirs when rivers are not present. The findings are relevant in a scenario where ever more interconnections of aquatic bodies have been diffused around the world.},

Understanding the potential effect of these changes on aquatic ecosystems is critical for long-term water management to maintain a balance between water for human consumption and ecosystem needs.                                                                          Fish species data and streamflow estimates from a rainfall-runoff and flow routing model were used to develop boosted regression tree models to predict the relationship between streamflow and fish species richness (                     FSR                     ) under plausible scenarios of (1) water withdrawal, (2) climate change and (3) increases in impervious surfaces in the Piedmont ecoregion of North Carolina,                     U.S.A.                     Maximum monthly flow, the fraction of total flow originating from impervious surface runoff, coefficient of monthly streamflow variability, and the specific river basin accounted for 50\% of the variability in                     FSR                     . This model was used to predict                     FSR                     values for all twelve-digit Hydrological Unit Code catchments (                     HUC                     -12s) in the North Carolina Piedmont under current flow conditions and under water withdrawal, climate change and impervious surface scenarios.                                                                                             Flow--ecology modeling results indicate that predicted                     FSR                     declined significantly with increased water withdrawals. However, the magnitude of decline varied geographically. A ``hot-spot'' analysis was conducted based on predicted changes in                     FSR                     under each scenario to understand which                     HUC                     -12s were most likely to be affected by changes in water withdrawals, climate and impervious surfaces. Under the 20\% withdrawal increase scenario, 413 of 886 (47\%)                     HUC                     -12s in the study area were predicted to lose one or more species.                     HUC                     -12s in the Broad, Catawba, Yadkin and Cape Fear river basins were most susceptible to species loss.                                                                                             These findings may help decision making efforts by identifying catchments most vulnerable to changing water availability. Additionally,                     FSR                     -discharge modeling results can assist resource agencies, water managers and stakeholders in assessing the effect of water withdrawals in catchments to better support the protection and long-term conservation of species.},

The questions arise as to whether different rivers respond similarly to artificial floods, and what are the long-term ecological consequences of such flood programs? This study evaluated abiotic/biotic dynamics during experimental floods in two rivers with contrasting valley morphologies (canyon-confined vs open-valley) as well as long-term response patterns of macroinvertebrates in both rivers to 16 years of experimental floods. Both systems showed an increase in measured parameters (turbidity, total phosphorus, drift, seston) during the rising limb of the flood with subsequent decreases being observed before the falling limb of the flood (all parameters displayed typical hysteresis patterns with discharge). Contrasting differences existed in respect to immediate effects of these two floods on macroinvertebrates and benthic periphyton (decreases or no change). Over the long term, major channel changes occurred from initial floods with less change observed from later floods in both systems. Macroinvertebrate densities fluctuated seasonally, but showed no long-term response to the flood program, whereas taxa richness increased in both systems. The rivers differed in macroinvertebrate community structure and this was reflected in shifts in community assembly over the study period in both systems (being substantially greater in the system flowing through a confined valley). The results suggest that immediate flood effects are quite similar among rivers, even over multiple years, but long-term trajectories in community assembly reflect changes in local habitat conditions in respect to external drivers such as landscape geomorphology.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In undammed watersheds in Mediterranean climates, the timing and abruptness of the transition from the dry season to the wet season have major implications for aquatic ecosystems. Of particular concern in many coastal areas is whether this transition can provide sufficient flows at the right time to allow passage for spawning anadromous fish, which is determined by dry season baseflow rates and the timing of the onset of the rainy season. In (semi-) ephemeral watershed systems, these functional flows also dictate the timing of full reconnection of the stream system. In this study, we propose methods to predict, approximately 5~months in advance, two key hydrologic metrics in the undammed rural Scott River watershed in northern California. The two metrics are intended to characterize (1)~the severity of a dry year and (2)~the relative timing of the transition from the dry to the wet season. The ability to predict these metrics in advance could support seasonal adaptive management. The first metric is the minimum 30\,d dry season baseflow volume, Vmin, which occurs at the end of the dry season (September--October) in this Mediterranean climate. The second metric is the cumulative precipitation, starting 1~September, necessary to bring the watershed to a ``full'' or ``spilling'' condition (i.e.,~initiate the onset of wet season storm- or baseflows) after the end of the dry season, referred to here as Pspill. As potential predictors of these two metrics, we assess maximum snowpack, cumulative precipitation, the timing of the snowpack and precipitation, spring groundwater levels, spring river flows, reference evapotranspiration, and a subset of these metrics from the previous water year. Though many of these predictors are correlated with the two metrics of interest, we find that the best prediction for both metrics is a linear combination of the maximum snowpack water content and total October--April precipitation. These two linear models could reproduce historical values of Vmin and Pspill with an average model error~(RMSE) of 1.4\,Mm3 per 30\,d (19.4~cfs) and 25.4\,mm (1~in.), corresponding to 49\,\% and 37\,\% of mean observed values, respectively. Although these predictive indices could be used by governance entities to support local water management, careful consideration of baseline conditions used as a basis for prediction is necessary.},

  abstract = {A persistent challenge in integrated water management is the ability to accurately evaluate human and ecological tradeoffs. Two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models are frequently used to evaluate water management alternatives concerning aquatic species physical habitat needs or preferences. Recent studies have assessed the timing or duration of suitable habitat conditions, but no standardized approach exists to integrate and interpret ecohydraulic model outputs within a water management framework. Such an approach is needed to maximize the information obtained from model outputs and to facilitate communication between river scientists and water managers. This study presents a general framework to aggregate and summarize 2D hydraulic model outputs by adapting the traditional water resources metrics of reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and sustainability. Just as these metrics are typically used to quantify distinct aspects of water resources performance, applying them to ecohydraulic conditions facilitates interpretation of ecological performance and human-ecosystem water management tradeoffs. This paper examines the utility and limitations of the proposed framework and metrics in a simple application to fall-run Chinook salmon in a typical Mediterranean-montane stream.},

  abstract = {Flow regimes profoundly influence river organisms and ecosystem functions, but regulatory approaches often lack the scientific basis to support sustainable water allocation. In part, this reflects the challenge of understanding the ecological effects of flow variability over different temporal and spatial domains. Here, we use a process-based distributed hydrological model to simulate 23 years of natural flow regime in 100 bioassessment sites across the Adige River network (NE Italy), and to identify typical nivo-glacial, nivo-pluvial, and pluvial reaches. We then applied spatial stream-network models (SSN) to investigate the relationships between hydrologic and macroinvertebrate metrics while accounting for network spatial autocorrelation and local habitat conditions. Macroinvertebrate metrics correlated most strongly with summer, winter, and temporal variation in streamflow, but effects varied across flow regime types. For example (i) taxon richness appeared limited by high summer flows and high winter flows in nivo-glacial and pluvial streams, respectively; (ii) invertebrate grazers increased proportionally with the annual coefficient of flow variation in nivo-glacial streams but tended to decline with flow variation in pluvial streams. Although local land-use and water quality also affected benthic communities, most variation in macroinvertebrate metrics was associated with spatial autocorrelation. These findings highlight the importance of developing environmental flow management policies in ways that reflect specific hydro-ecological and land use contexts. Our analyses also illustrate the importance of spatiallyexplicit approaches that account for auto-correlation when quantifying flow-ecology relationships.},

  abstract = {Groundwater-dependent cities face increasing population and changes in urban land use, threatening long-term aquifer sustainability by simultaneously increasing pumping demand while modifying recharge rates. Aquifer management involves a portfolio of alternatives to balance the sustainability of multiple water supply sources, including novel recharge alternatives to supplement traditional groundwater and surface water sources. However, potential managed aquifer recharge solutions can lead to unintended consequences as modern infrastructure and management alter natural hydrology, changing the underlying groundwater paradigm. This study uses a multiobjective analysis approach to evaluate the performance of spatially distributed aquifer management alternatives for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), a region where the population has increased by 48\% and urban land use by 35\% in the last 30 years. Recharge alternatives are evaluated using a physically based groundwater model that incorporates land and water use trends, and include: repairs to the water supply distribution network, increased wastewater treatment and infiltration, and increased infiltration of imported water supplies. These alternatives are compared according to planning objectives aggregated over three overlapping subregions within the model to minimize energy use for pumping, minimize water quality risks in subsidence-prone areas, and minimize groundwater flooding in urban areas. Results indicate that management alternatives resulting in equivalent changes in storage can exhibit spatially distinct reductions in drawdown over the historical period. Additionally, combining multiple alternatives results in a more than an additive risk of groundwater flooding, demonstrating the need for mitigation of rising water tables. This model will serve as the basis for future spatial optimization studies under future climate and land use scenarios. These approaches have broad applicability in other rapidly urbanizing regions dependent on groundwater supplies.},

A regional framework for biologically based flow management can help catchment managers prioritise streams for protection, evaluate impacts of disturbance or interventions and provide a starting point for causal assessment in degraded streams. However, lack of flow data limit the ability to assess hydrologic conditions across a region.                                                     Hydrologic models can address this problem. Regionally calibrated hydrologic models were used to estimate current and reference flows at 572 bioassessment sites in southern and central coastal California. Flow alteration was characterised as the difference in 39 flow metrics calculated from simulations of present-day and reference flow time-series, calculated under up to four precipitation conditions.                                                                          Biological condition was assessed with the California Stream Condition Index (                     CSCI                     ) and its components. Logistic regressions were used to predict the likelihood of high scores (i.e. {$\geq$}10th percentile of the                     CSCI                     reference calibration data). Statistically significant relationships between increasing severity of hydrologic alteration and decreasing biological condition were used to set thresholds that reflected tolerance for risk of a stakeholder advisory group.                                                                                             An index of hydrologic alteration was created by selecting flow metrics based on their importance for predicting biological response variables in boosted regression tree models. Metrics were selected in the order of decreasing importance, and no more than two metrics per metric class were selected (i.e. duration, frequency, magnitude, timing and variability). Seven metrics were selected: HighDur (duration of high-flow events), HighNum (\# of high-flow events), NoDisturb (duration between high- or low-flow events), MaxMonthQ (maximum monthly discharge), Q99 (99th percentile of daily streamflow), Qmax                     IDR                     (interdecile range of annual maxima) and                     RBI                     (Richards--Baker Index).                                                                        Applying the index to data from a probabilistic survey, 34\% of stream-miles in southern California were estimated to be hydrologically altered. One of four management priorities were assigned to each site based on biological condition and hydrologic status: protection (healthy and unaltered, 52\% of stream-miles), monitoring (healthy but altered 4\%), evaluation of flow management (unhealthy and altered, 30\%) and evaluation of other management (unhealthy but unaltered, 14\%).                                                     Regionally derived biologically based targets for flow alteration allow catchment managers to prioritise activities and conduct screenings for causal assessments across large spatial scales. Furthermore, regional tools pave the way for incorporation of hydrologic management in policies and catchment planning designed to support biological integrity in streams. Development of regional tools should be a priority where hydrologic alteration is pervasive or expected to increase in response to climate change or urbanisation.},

  abstract = {River flow regimes, controlled by climatic and catchment factors, vary over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. This hydrological dynamism is important in determining the structure and functioning of riverine ecosystems; however, such hydroecological associations remain poorly quantified. This paper explores and models relationships between a suite of flow regime predictors and macroinvertebrate community metrics from 83 rivers in England and Wales. A two-stage analytical approach was employed: (1) classification of 83 river basins based upon the magnitude and shape (form) of their long-term (1980--1999) average annual regime to group basins with similar flow responses; and (2) examination of relationships between a total of 201 flow regime descriptors identified by previous researchers and macroinvertebrate community metrics for the whole data set and long-term flow regime classes over an 11-year period (1990--2000). The classification method highlighted largescale patterns in river flow regimes, identifying five magnitude classes and three shape classes. A west-east trend of flow regime magnitude (high-low) and timing (early-late peak) was displayed across the study area, reflecting climatic gradients and basin controls (e.g. lithology). From the suite of hydrological variables, those associated with the magnitude of the flow regime consistently produced the strongest relationships with macroinvertebrate community metrics for all sites and for the long-term regime composite classes. The results indicate that the classification (subdivision) of rivers into flow regime regions potentially offers a means of increasing predictive capacity and, in turn, better management of fluvial hydrosystems. \# Crown copyright 2006.

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal variability in river flow is a fundamental control on instream habitat structure and riverine ecosystem biodiversity and integrity. However, long-term riverine ecological time-series to test hypotheses about hydrology--ecology interactions in a broader temporal context are rare, and studies spanning multiple rivers are often limited in their temporal coverage to less than five years. To address this research gap, a unique spatio-temporal hydroecological analysis was conducted of long-term instream ecological responses (1990--2000) to river flow regime variability at 83 sites across England and Wales. The results demonstrate clear hydroecological associations at the national scale (all data). In addition, significant differences in ecological response are recorded between three `regions' identified (RM1--3 ) associated with characteristics of the flow regime. The effect of two major supra-seasonal droughts (1990--1992 and 1996--1997) on inter-annual (IA) variability of the LIFE scores is evident with both events showing a gradual decline before and recovery of LIFE scores after the low flow period. The instream community response to high magnitude flow regimes (1994 and 1995) is also apparent, although these associations are less striking. The results demonstrate classification of rivers into flow regime regions offers a way to help unravel complex hydroecological associations. The approach adopted herein could easily be adapted for other geographical locations, where datasets are available. Such work is imperative to understand flow regime--ecology interactions in a longer term, wider spatial context and so assess future hydroecological responses to climate change and anthropogenic modification of riverine ecosystems.

  abstract = {Temporary streams in California and other Mediterranean climate areas are among the aquatic habitats most altered by human actions and by invasions by alien species. They typically support novel ecosystems, defined as ecosystems dominated by new combinations of organisms in highly altered habitats. Although these new ecosystems have many attributes of the ecosystems they replaced, such as native species, they typically contain many new interactions among species. Managers need to recognize this reality to find ways to direct change towards novel ecosystems with desirable features, including native species. The concept of reconciliation ecology is a practical approach to living with the new reality; it includes actively guiding ecosystem change, as illustrated by Putah Creek, Cosumnes River, Eel River and Six Bit Gulch in California. The first three waterways are all highly altered and managed with varying degrees of success to favour desired aquatic species, whereas Six Bit Gulch experiences such extreme conditions that the original ecosystem is still largely intact. The examples illustrate that most aquatic ecosystems in California are so highly altered that attempting to restore them to an earlier condition or stable state is largely not possible. Where more or less intact systems persist, it is usually because extreme environmental conditions restrict both alien invaders and human use in small watersheds. This pattern appears to be fairly typical of streams in Mediterranean climate areas. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In regions like California with highly seasonal flow patterns and immense interannual variability, a rigorous approach is needed to accurately identify and quantify seasonal flow transitions from the annual flow regime. Drawing on signal processing theory, this study develops a transferable approach to detect the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily streamflow time series using an iterative smoothing, feature detection, and windowing methodology. The approach is shown to accurately identify and characterize seasonal flows across highly variable natural flow regimes in California. A quantitative error assessment validated the accuracy of the approach, finding that inaccuracies in seasonal timing identification did not exceed 10\%, with infrequent exceptions. Results for seasonal timing were also used to highlight the statistically distinct timing found across streams with varying climatic drivers in California. The proposed approach improves understanding of spatial and temporal trends in hydrologic processes and climate conditions across complex landscapes and informs environmental water management efforts by delineating timing of seasonal flows.},

  abstract = {Large state or regional environmental flow programs, such as the one based on the California Environmental Flows Framework, rely on broadly applicable relationships between flow and ecology to inform management decisions. California, despite having high flow and bioassessment data density, has not established relationships between specific elements of the annual hydrograph and biological stream condition. To address this, we spatially and temporally linked USGS gage stations and biological assessment sites in California to identify suitable paired sites for comparisons of streamflow alteration with biological condition at a statewide scale. Flows were assessed using a set of functional flow metrics that provide a comprehensive way to compare alteration and seasonal variation in streamflow across different locations. Biological response was evaluated using the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) and Algal Stream Condition Index (ASCI), which quantify biological conditions by translating benthic invertebrate or algal resources and watershed-scale environmental data into an overall measure of stream health. These indices provide a consistent statewide standard for interpreting bioassessment data, and thus, a means of quantitatively comparing stream conditions throughout the state. The results indicate that indices of biological stream condition were most closely associated with flow alteration in seasonality and timing metrics, such as fall pulse timing, dry-season timing, and wet season timing. Magnitude metrics such as dry-season baseflow, wet season baseflow, and the fall pulse magnitude were also important in influencing biological stream conditions. Development of ecological flow needs in large-scale environmental programs should consider that alteration to any of the seasonal flow components (e.g., dry-season baseflow, fall pulse flow, wet-season baseflow, spring recession flow) may be important in restructuring biological communities.},

  abstract = {Shifts away from the historical hydroclimate in populated regions can have dire consequences for water management. Regions like the state of California---where highly engineered, geographically interconnected, and inflexible water management systems are predicated on particular spatiotemporal patterns of water availability---are particularly vulnerable to hydroclimate shifts. However, much of the analysis of hydroclimate sensitivity to anthropogenic climate change has focused on gross metrics like annual mean precipitation, which is highly uncertain at the regional scale. This perceived uncertainty has deterred adaptation investments and quantitative integration of climate projection data into regional water management. Here, we assess projected future shifts in the state of California in a range of hydroclimate metrics critical to water management, using data from 10 statistically downscaled global climate model and two emissions scenarios currently used by the state. We find substantial inter-model agreement under both emissions scenarios---and {$>$} 80\% inter-model agreement under the more severe climate change scenario---across metrics that collectively point toward an increasingly volatile, temporally concentrated, and extreme precipitation future for the state. We show, via hydrologic and operations modeling, that accounting for shifts in these more nuanced metrics reduces the projected reliability and sustainability of current water management practices to a greater degree than would be inferred from changes in total annual precipitation alone. These results highlight both the viability and critical importance of incorporating climate change projections quantitatively into water management decisions in California and other regions vulnerable to hydroclimate shifts, and underscore the need to develop integrated climate-hydrologic-operations models and decision-making protocols capable of accounting for all projected hydroclimate shifts.},

Managers striving to sustain these services in the face of changing climate, land uses, and water demands need tools to assess the potential effectiveness of alternative management actions, and often, the resulting tradeoffs between competing objectives. Integrating predictive modeling with monitoring data in an adaptive management framework provides a process by which managers can reduce model uncertainties and thus improve the scientific bases for subsequent decisions. We demonstrate an integration of monitoring data with a dynamic, metapopulation model developed to assess effects of streamflow alteration on fish occupancy in a southeastern US stream system. Although not extensive (collected over three years at nine sites), the monitoring data allowed us to assess and update support for alternative population dynamic models using model probabilities and Bayes rule. We then use the updated model weights to estimate the effects of water withdrawal on stream fish communities and demonstrate how feedback in the form of monitoring data can be used to improve water resource decision making. We conclude that investment in more strategic monitoring, guided by a priori model predictions under alternative hypotheses and an adaptive sampling design, could substantially improve the information available to guide decisionmaking and management for ecosystem services from lotic systems.},

  abstract = {Summary             1. The flow regime is a primary determinant of the structure and function of aquatic and riparian ecosystems for streams and rivers. Hydrologic alteration has impaired riverine ecosystems on a global scale, and the pace and intensity of human development greatly exceeds the ability of scientists to assess the effects on a river-by-river basis. Current scientific understanding of hydrologic controls on riverine ecosystems and experience gained from individual river studies support development of environmental flow standards at the regional scale.             2. This paper presents a consensus view from a group of international scientists on a new framework for assessing environmental flow needs for many streams and rivers simultaneously to foster development and implementation of environmental flow standards at the regional scale. This framework, the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration (ELOHA), is a synthesis of a number of existing hydrologic techniques and environmental flow methods that are currently being used to various degrees and that can support comprehensive regional flow management. The flexible approach allows scientists, water-resource managers and stakeholders to analyse and synthesise available scientific information into ecologically based and socially acceptable goals and standards for management of environmental flows.             3. The ELOHA framework includes the synthesis of existing hydrologic and ecological databases from many rivers within a user-defined region to develop scientifically defensible and empirically testable relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses. These relationships serve as the basis for the societally driven process of developing regional flow standards. This is to be achieved by first using hydrologic modelling to build a `hydrologic foundation' of baseline and current hydrographs for stream and river segments throughout the region. Second, using a set of ecologically relevant flow variables, river segments within the region are classified into a few distinctive flow regime types that are expected to have different ecological characteristics. These river types can be further subclassified according to important geomorphic features that define hydraulic habitat features. Third, the deviation of current-condition flows from baseline-condition flow is determined. Fourth, flow alteration--ecological response relationships are developed for each river type, based on a combination of existing hydroecological literature, expert knowledge and field studies across gradients of hydrologic alteration.             4. Scientific uncertainty will exist in the flow alteration--ecological response relationships, in part because of the confounding of hydrologic alteration with other important environmental determinants of river ecosystem condition (e.g. temperature). Application of the ELOHA framework should therefore occur in a consensus context where stakeholders and decision-makers explicitly evaluate acceptable risk as a balance between the perceived value of the ecological goals, the economic costs involved and the scientific uncertainties in functional relationships between ecological responses and flow alteration.             5. The ELOHA framework also should proceed in an adaptive management context, where collection of monitoring data or targeted field sampling data allows for testing of the proposed flow alteration--ecological response relationships. This empirical validation process allows for a fine-tuning of environmental flow management targets. The ELOHA framework can be used both to guide basic research in hydroecology and to further implementation of more comprehensive environmental flow management of freshwater sustainability on a global scale.},

Ecological responses were characterised according to taxonomic identity (macroinvertebrates, fish, riparian vegetation) and type of response (abundance, diversity, demographic parameters). A `qualitative' or narrative summary of the reported results strongly corroborated previous, less comprehensive, reviews by documenting strong and variable ecological responses to all types of flow alteration. Of the 165 papers, 152 (92\%) reported decreased values for recorded ecological metrics in response to a variety of types of flow alteration, whereas 21 papers (13\%) reported increased values.             3.{\enspace}Fifty-five papers had information suitable for quantitative analysis of ecological response to flow alteration. Seventy per cent of these papers reported on alteration in flow magnitude, yielding a total of 65 data points suitable for analysis. The quantitative analysis provided some insight into the relative sensitivities of different ecological groups to alteration in flow magnitudes, but robust statistical relationships were not supported. Macroinvertebrates showed mixed responses to changes in flow magnitude, with abundance and diversity both increasing and decreasing in response to elevated flows and to reduced flows. Fish abundance, diversity and demographic rates consistently declined in response to both elevated and reduced flow magnitude. Riparian vegetation metrics both increased and decreased in response to reduced peak flows, with increases reflecting mostly enhanced non-woody vegetative cover or encroachment into the stream channel.             4.{\enspace}Our analyses do not support the use of the existing global literature to develop general, transferable quantitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological response; however, they do support the inference that flow alteration is associated with ecological change and that the risk of ecological change increases with increasing magnitude of flow alteration.             5.{\enspace}New sampling programs and analyses that target sites across well-defined gradients of flow alteration are needed to quantify ecological response and develop robust and general flow alteration--ecological response relationships.

  abstract = {Inequalities persist in the geosciences. White women and people of color remain underrepresented at all levels of academic faculty, including positions of power such as departmental and institutional leadership. While the proportion of women among geoscience faculty has been cataloged previously, new programs and initiatives aimed at improving diversity, focused on institutional factors that affect equity in the geosciences, necessitate an updated study and a new metric for quantifying the biases that result in under-representation. We compile a data set of 2,531 tenured and tenure-track geoscience faculty from 62 universities in the United States to evaluate the proportion of women by rank and discipline. We find that 27\% of faculty are women. The fraction of women in the faculty pool decreases with rank, as women comprise 46\% of assistant professors, 34\% of associate professors, and 19\% of full professors. We quantify the attrition of women in terms of a fractionation factor, which describes the rate of loss of women along the tenure track and allows us to move away from the metaphor of the ``leaky pipeline.'' Efforts to address inequities in institutional culture and biases in promotion and hiring practices over the past few years may provide insight into the recent positive shifts in fractionation factor. Our results suggest a need for 1:1 hiring between men and women to reach gender parity. Due to significant disparities in race, this work is most applicable to white women, and our use of the gender binary does not represent gender diversity in the geosciences.},

The Scott River rotary screw trap has been in operation since 2000. One rotary screw trap was operated from February 21 to July 14, 2023, to sample all age classes of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) emigrating from the Scott River. Mark and recapture trials were conducted multiple times per week to determine trap efficiencies and weekly population estimates. Established age-length cutoffs for each species were used to determine the age of the fish captured. In-stream conditions such as flow and water temperature were also monitored. Weekly estimates for the smolt class of all target species were compared to previous results to evaluate multi-year population trends. Additionally, using multi-year seasonal production estimates and Coho Salmon adult returns to the Scott River, adult survival and smolt production estimates were calculated. For the period sampled in 2023, we estimated that a total of 12,540 0+ and 4,014 1+ Coho Salmon; and 26,337 0+, and 8,775 1+ emigrated from the Scott River. Mark-recapture efficiency trials could not be conducted or were not successful for Chinook salmon, and age 2+ and 3+ Steelhead so production estimates were not generated for these species age classes in 2023.},

  abstract = {Quantifying flow of groundwater through streambeds often is difficult due to the complexity of aquifer-scale heterogeneity combined with local-scale hyporheic exchange. We used fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS), seepage meters, and vertical temperature profiling to locate, quantify, and monitor areas of focused groundwater discharge in a geomorphically simple sand-bed stream. This combined approach allowed us to rapidly focus efforts at locations where prodigious amounts of groundwater discharged to the Quashnet River on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, northeastern USA. FO-DTS detected numerous anomalously cold reaches one to several m long that persisted over two summers. Seepage meters positioned upstream, within, and downstream of 7 anomalously cold reaches indicated that rapid groundwater discharge occurred precisely where the bed was cold; median upward seepage was nearly 5 times faster than seepage measured in streambed areas not identified as cold. Vertical temperature profilers deployed next to 8 seepage meters provided diurnal-signal-based seepage estimates that compared remarkably well with seepage-meter values. Regression slope and R2 values both were near 1 for seepage ranging from 0.05 to 3.0 m d21. Temperature-based seepage model accuracy was improved with thermal diffusivity determined locally from diurnal signals. Similar calculations provided values for streambed sediment scour and deposition at subdaily resolution. Seepage was strongly heterogeneous even along a sandbed river that flows over a relatively uniform sand and fine-gravel aquifer. FO-DTS was an efficient method for detecting areas of rapid groundwater discharge, even in a strongly gaining river, that can then be quantified over time with inexpensive streambed thermal methods.},

  abstract = {The Pajaro River, central coastal California, consistently loses 0.2--0.4 m3/s of discharge along an 11.42-km experimental reach late in the water year, when discharge is 64.5 m3/s. Channel loss occurs throughout this reach, but is greatest in magnitude near the bottom of the reach. Water isotopic data and other observations suggest that channel loss results mainly from streambed seepage, as opposed to evapotranspiration. If it occurs throughout the year, the channel loss along this short stream reach could contribute 6--13 {$\cdot$} 106 m3 of annual aquifer recharge, or 20--40\% of current sustainable basin yield. We performed a series of tracer injections along this reach to determine if hydrologic exchange occurs within this strongly-losing stream. We found that during periods of high channel loss, there were also comparable storage exchange fluxes and lateral inflow of tracer-free water. Within upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, storage exchange fluxes are about 10 times greater than lateral inflow. The former are associated with the movement of water between the main channel and surface or subsurface storage zones. In this system, it is likely that the latter are primarily associated with spatially- or temporally-long subsurface flow paths within the shallow streambed, as opposed to inflow of ground water from deeper in the basin. Along both upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, lateral inflow tends to increase as channel discharge decreases. In contrast, storage exchange fluxes increase with decreasing discharge along the upper parts of the reach, but decrease with decreasing discharge along the lower parts. Gauging and tracer test results suggest that subsurface storage exchange and loss may occur c 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Quantifying groundwater discharge remains a challenge due to its large temporal and spatial variability. Here, we quantify groundwater discharge into a small estuary using radon (222Rn) and radium isotopes (223Ra and 224Ra). High temporal resolution (30 min time steps) radon observations at 4 time series stations were used to determine where groundwater discharge is prevalent in the estuary, and to reduce mass balance model uncertainties. A three-endmember mixing model was developed based on short-lived radium isotopes (sampled at a single location) to separate the shallow saline and deep fresh sources of the discharging groundwater. The results show that using multiple 222Rn time series stations decreased the overall uncertainty of groundwater discharge estimates from about 41\% to 23\%. The radon derived groundwater flux was 56 {\textpm} 13 and 35 {\textpm} 12 cm d 1 in wet and dry conditions, respectively. The spatially distributed stations detected a well-defined small area located four kilometers upstream from the mouth of the estuary as a groundwater discharging hotspot. Estimates based on a 223Ra and 224Ra mass balance resulted in groundwater discharge estimates of 65 {\textpm} 18 and 84 {\textpm} 48 cm d 1 in the wet and 18 {\textpm} 5 and 20 {\textpm} 6 cm d 1 in the dry. The mixing model revealed contrasting results for deep vs. fresh groundwater contribution in wet and dry conditions. In wet conditions, deep fresh groundwater discharging into the estuary contributed 65\% compared to the shallow saline groundwater (35\%), while during dry conditions a larger contribution (80\%) was related to shallow groundwater. A comprehensive spatial and temporal sampling strategy can produce groundwater discharge estimates with lower uncertainty and provides additional insight on where groundwater enters surface waters.},

Trend analyses were applied to indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHAs) at 34 streamgages over a 50-year period (1962--2012). Results showed a significant negative trend in annual streamflow for 10 of 12 western streamgages (up to -7.65 mm/50 years) and smaller negative trends for most other streamgages. Significant negative trends in western basin streamflow were more widespread in summer (12 stations) than in winter or spring (6 stations). The negative-trend magnitude and significance decreased from west to east for maximum-flow IHAs. Minimum-flow IHAs, however, significantly decreased at High Plains streamgages but significantly increased at Central Great Plains streamgages. Number of zero-flow days showed positive trends in the High Plains. Most streamgages showed negative trends in low- and high-flow pulse frequency and high-flow pulse duration, and positive trends in low-flow pulse duration. These results were consistent with increasing occurrence of drought. Shift in occurrence from present (1860--1950) to absent (2000--2012) was significantly related (p {$<$} .10) to negative trends of 1-day maximum flows (both species) and indices associated with reduced spawning-season flows for Plains Minnow and shifting annual-flow timing and increased flow intermittency for Common Shiner. Both species were absent for all western basin sites and had different responses to hydrological index trends at eastern basin sites. These results demonstrate ecohydrological index changes impact distributions of native fish and suggest target factors for assessment or restoration activities.},

These relationships can be specific for different natural flow regime types. The object of our study is testing the ELOHA method in the Ebro River Basin. Seven flow alteration--ecological response curves were obtained in the present study as preliminary guidelines for developing and calibrating environmental flow standards in the Ebro River Basin. For continental Mediterranean-pluvial flow regime mean monthly flow in March was related to Plecoptera abundance (ELOHAs {\textpm}21\% from baseline), and high flow magnitude and frequency were closely related to Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera richness (ELOHAs for high flow magnitude and frequency were +18 and +54\% the reference central value respectively). For nivo-pluvial flow regime, high flow magnitude was found indicative of macroinvertebrate biodiversity and Coleoptera abundance (ELOHAS 12 and +23\% from central reference value respectively). And for pluvio-oceanic flow regime, mean monthly flow in January was indicative of the proportion of Gastropoda, Oligochaeta and Diptera taxa (GOLD index) (ELOHA +17\% from baseline). These hydrological limits are endorsed by recent international reference works. Flow alteration--ecological relationships presented here were constructed from real monthly flow data records and macroinvertebrate samples at family level. ELOHA values obtained in this study pretend to be a starting point for implementing an environmental flow regime program in the Ebro River Basin.

This is especially true for irrigated agricultural basins with a strong connection between land use, groundwater, and surface water. Using a range rather than a single set of initial parameter values, multiple sensitivity analyses, calibrations, and linearity tests were performed using UCODE\_2014 on the Scott Valley Integrated Hydrologic Model. Calibration results show that parameters related to crop demand and applied irrigation water are most sensitive. Influence statistics show that low streamflow observations provide the most information during model calibration, indicating preference should be given to these observations during model development, sensitivity analysis, and calibration. Importantly, due to the nonlinearity of the integrated model, significant differences are found in results when initial parameter values are sampled from within their respective expected ranges. Estimates for some parameters varied up to an order of magnitude between calibrations, while all produced similar final objective function values, groundwater elevations, and stream flow. Confidence intervals for individual sensitivity analyses and calibration runs only spanned a fraction of the ensemble estimated parameter range across multiple runs. Our work suggests that a calibration design with multiple sensitivity analyses and calibrations of integrated hydrologic models, each using one of several widely varying sets of initial values, provides a frugal approach to identify parameters across the global parameter space.},

Two fish species, schizothorax (Schizothorax) and schizothorax (Racoma), representing a main and an endangered fish species, respectively of the Kraal River, were studied; their habitats and abundance statuses were predicted and analyzed based on four different long-term dam operation scenarios. Fish-friendly river regulation scenarios were also examined. The temporal- and spatial-scale hydro-morphodynamic results indicate that the erosion effects are much more significant than the deposition effects. Our study suggests that habitat destruction and fragmentation existed for all presented river regulation scenarios. The analysis indicates that long-term river regulation will result in a decrease in the fish population. However, there will be different levels of decline for fish habitats and populations depending on the dam operation scenarios. This study contributes to a better understanding of the dam-induced temporal habitat fragmentation and response of fish communities. This study also provides quantitative evidence for suitable river regulation scenarios and fish stocking strategies, which can help the fish community recover to a stable level.},

  abstract = {The science and practice of environmental flows have advanced significantly over the last several decades. Most environmental flow approaches require quantifying the relationships between hydrologic change and biologic response, but this can be challenging to determine and implement due to high data requirements, limited transferability, and the abundance of hydrologic metrics available for evaluation. We suggest that a functional flows approach, focusing on elements of the natural flow regime known to sustain important ecosystem processes, offers a pathway for linking understanding of ecosystem processes with discrete, quantifiable measures of the flow regime for a broad range of native taxa and assemblages. Functional flow components can be identified as distinct aspects of the annual hydrograph that support key biophysical processes, such as wet season flood flows or spring recession flows, and then quantified by flow metrics, such as 5\% exceedance flow or daily percent decrease in flow, respectively. By selecting a discrete set of flow metrics that measure key functional flow components, the spatial and temporal complexity of flow regimes can be managed in a holistic manner supportive of multiple ecological processes and native aquatic species requirements. We provide an overview of the functional flows approach to selecting a defined set of flow metrics and illustrate its application in two seasonally variable stream systems. We further discuss how a functional flows approach can be utilized as a conceptual model both within and outside of existing environmental flow frameworks to guide consideration of ecological processes when designing prescribed flow regimes.},

  abstract = {The paired catchment approach has been the predominant method for detecting the effects of disturbance on catchment-scale hydrology. Notwithstanding, the utility of this approach is limited by regression model sample size, variability between paired catchments, type II error, and the inability of locating a long-term suitable control. An increasingly common practice is to use rainfall-runoff models to discern the effect of disturbance on hydrology, but few hydrologic model studies (1) consider problems associated with model identification, (2) use formal statistical methods to evaluate the significance of hydrologic change relative to variations in rainfall and streamflow, and (3) apply change detection models to undisturbed catchments to test the approach. We present an alternative method to the paired catchment approach and improve on stand-alone hydrologic modeling to discern the effects of forest harvesting at the catchment scale. Our method combines rainfall-runoff modeling to account for natural fluctuations in daily streamflow, uncertainty analyses using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method to identify and separate hydrologic model uncertainty from unexplained variation, and GLS regression change detection models to provide a formal experimental framework for detecting changes in daily streamflow relative to variations in daily hydrologic and climatic data. We include statistical analyses of climate variation and a two-part evaluation to explore model performance and account for unexplained variation. Evaluations consisted of applying our method to a control catchment and to a period prior to harvesting in a treated catchment to demonstrate that our method was capable of capturing the absence of land use change in an undisturbed catchment and capturing the absence of land use change during a period of no disturbance in the harvested catchment. In addition, we explore the sensitivity of our method to model identification, number of simulations, and likelihood thresholds for model identification. We show that an increase in the number of model simulations does not necessarily result in increased change detection performance. Our method is a potentially useful alternative to the paired catchment approach where reference catchments are not possible and to stand-alone hydrologic modeling for detecting the effects of land use change on hydrology.},
