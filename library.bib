abstract = {Extinction risk is inversely associated with maximum per capita population growth rate (rmax). However, this parameter is not known for most threatened species, underscoring the value in identifying correlates of rmax that, in the absence of demographic data, would indirectly allow one to identify species and populations at elevated risk of extinction and their associated recovery potential. We undertook a comparative life-history analysis of 199 species from three taxonomic classes: Chondrichthyes (e.g., sharks; n ¼ 82), Actinopterygii (teleost or bony fishes; n ¼ 47), and Mammalia (n ¼ 70, including 16 marine species). Median rmax was highest for (and similar between) terrestrial mammals (0.71) and teleosts (0.43), significantly lower among chondrichthyans (0.26), and lower still in marine mammals (0.07). Age at maturity was the primary (and negative) correlate of rmax. In contrast, although body size was negatively correlated with rmax in chondrichthyans and mammals, evidence of an association in teleosts was equivocal, and fecundity was not related to rmax in fishes, despite recurring assertions to the contrary. Our analyses suggest that age at maturity can serve as a universal predictor of extinction risk in fishes and mammals when rmax itself is unknown. Moreover, in contrast to what is generally expected, the recovery potential of teleost fishes does not differ from that of terrestrial mammals. Our findings are supportive of the application of extinction-risk criteria that are based on generation time and that are independent of taxonomic affinity.},

abstract = {Areas of improving and degrading groundwater-quality conditions in the State of California were assessed using spatial weighting of a new metric for scoring wells based on constituent concentrations and the direction and magnitude of a trend slope (Sen). Individual well scores were aggregated across 2135 equal-area grid cells covering the entire groundwater resource used for public supply in the state. Spatial weighting allows results to be aggregated locally (well or grid cell), regionally (groundwater basin), provincially, or statewide. Results differentiate degrading (increasing concentration trends) areas with low to moderate concentrations (unimpaired) from degrading areas with moderate to high concentrations (impaired). Results also differentiate improving areas (decreasing concentration trends) in the same manner. Multi-year to decadal groundwater-quality trends were computed from periodic, inorganic water-quality data for 38 constituents collected between 1974 and 2014 for compliance monitoring of nearly 13,000 public-supply wells (PSWs) in the State of California. Mann-Kendall (MK) rank correlations and Sen's slope estimator were used to detect statistically significant trends for the entire period of recorded data (long-term trend), for the period since 2000 (recent trend), for different pumping seasons (seasonal trend), and for reversals of trends. Statewide, the most frequently detected trends since 2000 were for nitrate (36{\%}), gross alpha/uranium (10{\%}), arsenic (14{\%}), total dissolved solids (TDS) (23{\%}), and the major ions that contribute to TDS (19–28{\%}). The Transverse and Selected Peninsular Ranges (TSPR) and the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) hydrogeologic provinces had the largest percentage of areas with moderate to high nitrate concentrations and groundwater quality trends. Improving nitrate concentrations in parts of the TSPR is associated with long-term managed aquifer recharge that has replaced historical, agriculturally affected groundwater with low-nitrate recharge in parts of the TSPR. This example suggests that application of dilute, excess surface water to agricultural fields during the winter could improve groundwater-quality in the SJV over the long term.},

@article{Dulvy2004,
abstract = {The decline and disappearance of species from large parts of their former geographical range has become an important issue in fisheries ecology. There is a need to identify which species are at risk of extinction. The available approaches have been subject to considerable debate - particularly when applied to commercially exploited species. Here we have compiled methods that have been used or may be used for assessing threat status of marine organisms. We organize the methods according to the availability of data on the natural history, ecology and population biology of species. There are three general approaches to inferring or assessing extinction risk: (i) correlative approaches based on knowledge of life histories and ecology; (ii) time-series approaches that examine changes in abundance; and (iii) demographic approaches based on age- or stage-based schedules of vital rates and fisheries reference points. Many methods are well suited to species that are highly catchable and/or have relatively low productivity, but theory is less well developed for assessing extinction risk in species exhibiting narrow geographical distributions or ecological specialization. There is considerable variation in both definitions of extinction risk and the precision and defensibility of the available risk assessment methods, so we suggest a two-tiered approach for defining and assessing extinction risk. First, simple methods requiring a few easily estimated parameters are used to triage or rapidly assess large numbers of populations and species to identify potentially vulnerable populations or species. Second, the populations and species identified as vulnerable by this process can then be subject to more detailed and rigorous population analysis explicitly considering sources of error and uncertainty.},

@article{DoremusTarlock2003,
abstract = {In the drought summer of 2001, a dramatic event occurred in the obscure Klamath region of northern California and Southern Oregon: the Bureau of Reclamation closed the headgates of the Klamath Project, halting irrigation deliveries in order to protect endangered fish. For the first time, the Endangered Species Act had caused a large-scale curtailment of water delivery from a federal project. Several months later, a National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council committee issued a report critical of the scientific basis for the decision to cut off water deliveries, fueling controversy in the already deeply polarized region. The Klamath crisis and its continuing aftermath provide an important case study of the key challenges facing many communities in the arid West: how to move beyond a long history of inefficient irrigation, remedy the ecosystem degradation that system has produced, and make the transition from a colonial commodity-production economy to a modern, globally integrated one. The Klamath is a classic degraded, unsustainable basin, exhibiting all the environmental and economic woes of the "new" West. It is also a place where the ESA, which has been widely regarded as an important tool for forcing states and local populations to take into account new social realities, has been aggressively applied. This article explores the choices that led to the Klamath crisis, the crisis itself, and its aftermath. Although there are many ways to tell the Klamath story, the narrative we find most compelling is one of a clash of cultures that must be resolved as the arid West confronts its future. Farmers, environmentalists, and Indians are all fighting to protect their ideal of the landscape and their relationship to it. A similar culture war is played out within the federal government, as the Bureau of Reclamation and the wildlife agencies fight for supremacy in the Basin. We draw several lessons from the Klamath experience, all of which we believe apply more broadly. First, the pressing question, one that is complex from both a social and a scientific perspective, is how to manage the transition to a sustainable landscape in a fair and equitable manner. The deep cultural divide between groups affected by the use of water and lands in the region, and the pervasive uncertainties about the legal rights and responsibilities of those groups, have made the transition extremely difficult. Second, overemphasis on science as the arbiter of the legal, and indirectly of the cultural, disputes has deepened the cultural divide. Science plays a major role in the resolution of environmental disputes; it is often seen as the only potential unifying standard among parties with very different world views. Unfortunately, because of data gaps, uncertainties, and disagreement about values rather than facts, science frequently does not eliminate disagreement among opposing parties. In those circumstances, the intense battle for the high scientific ground that typically results is ultimately counter-productive, diverting attention from the difficult social choices that must be made. Third, solving conflicts with deep cultural implications over water (or other limited resources) is difficult and painful, so delay and avoidance have been common tactics. The Klamath experience teaches us that delay only serves to make the conflicts sharper, and therefore more difficult to resolve, when they can no longer be avoided. That lesson goes for irrigators as well as the government agencies. Finally, a more comprehensive ecosystem-based approach than is currently available is needed to encourage and support the transition to sustainability. State and federal agencies must work toward common solutions, and resource use issues (such as water allocation) must not be treated as separable from pollution issues (such as water quality control). The ESA can catalyze, but ultimately cannot force, a move to a more comprehensive approach. We offer the process that led to the current Florida Everglades restoration experiment as one possible model for that transition.},

abstract = {Groundwater pumping chronically exceeds natural recharge in many agricultural regions in California. A common method of recharging groundwater - when surface water is available - is to deliberately flood an open area, allowing water to percolate into an aquifer. However, open land suitable for this type of recharge is scarce. Flooding agricultural land during fallow or dormant periods has the potential to increase groundwater recharge substantially, but this approach has not been well studied. Using data on soils, topography and crop type, we developed a spatially explicit index of the suitability for groundwater recharge of land in all agricultural regions in California. We identified 3.6 million acres of agricultural land statewide as having Excellent or Good potential for groundwater recharge. The index provides preliminary guidance about the locations where groundwater recharge on agricultural land is likely to be feasible. A variety of institutional, infrastructure and other issues must also be addressed before this practice can be implemented widely.},

abstract = {Two new packages for the U.S. Geological Survey modular finite-difference ground-water-flow model MODFLOW-2000 are documented. The new packages provide flexibility in simulating evapo- transpiration and drain features not provided by the MODFLOW-2000 Evapotranspiration (EVT) and Drain (DRN) Packages. The report describes conceptualization of the packages, input instructions, list- ings and explanations of the source code, and example simulations. The new Evapotranspiration Segments (ETS1) Package allows simulation of evapotranspiration with a user-defined relation between evapotranspiration rate and hydraulic head. This capability provides a degree of flexibility not supported by the EVT Package, which has been available in MODFLOW since its initial release. In the ETS1 Package, the relation of evapotranspiration rate to hydraulic head is conceptualized as a segmented line between an evaporation surface, defined as the elevation where the evapotranspiration rate reaches a maximum, and an elevation located at an extinc- tion depth below the evaporation surface, where the evapotranspiration rate reaches zero. The user supplies input to define as many intermediate segment endpoints as desired to define the relation of evapotranspiration rate to head between these two elevations. The EVT Package, in contrast, simulates evapotranspiration with a single linear function. The new Drain Return (DRT1) Package can be used to simulate the return flow of water discharged from a drain feature back into the ground-water system. The DRN Package, which has been available in MODFLOWsince its initial release, does not have the capability to simulate return of flow. If the return-flow option of the DRT1 Package is selected, for each cell designated as a drain-return cell, the user has the option of specifying a proportion of the water simulated as leaving the ground-water system through the drain feature that is to be simulated as returning simultaneously to one other cell in the model.},

abstract = {Rapid growth and development in Carson Valley is causing concern over the continued availability of water resources to sustain such growth into the future. A study to address concerns over water resources and to update estimates of water-budget components in Carson Valley was begun in 2003 by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with Douglas County, Nevada. This report summarizes micrometeorologic, soil-chloride, and streambed-temperature data collected in Carson Valley from April 2003 through November 2004. Using these data, estimates of rates of discharge by evapotranspiration (ET), rates of recharge from precipitation in areas of native vegetation on the eastern and northern sides of the valley, and rates of recharge and discharge from streamflow infiltration and seepage on the valley floor were calculated. These rates can be used to develop updated water budgets for Carson Valley and to evaluate potential effects of land- and water-use changes on the valley's water budget. Data from eight ET stations provided estimates of annual ET during water year 2004, the sixth consecutive year of a drought with average or below average precipitation since 1999. Estimated annual ET from flood-irrigated alfalfa where the water table was from 3 to 6 feet below land surface was 3.1 feet. A similar amount of ET, 3.0 feet, was estimated from flood-irrigated alfalfa where the water table was about 40 feet below land surface. Estimated annual ET from flood-irrigated pasture ranged from 2.8 to 3.2 feet where the water table ranged from 2 to 5 feet below land surface, and was 4.4 feet where the water table was within 2 feet from land surface. Annual ET estimated from nonirrigated pasture was 1.7 feet. Annual ET estimated from native vegetation was 1.9 feet from stands of rabbitbrush and greasewood near the northern end of the valley, and 1.5 feet from stands of native bitterbrush and sagebrush covering alluvial fans along the western side of the valley. Uncertainty in most ET estimates is about 12 percent, but ranged from +30 and +50 percent to –20 and –40 percent for nonirrigated pasture and native bitterbrush and sagebrush. Estimated rates for water year 2004 likely are less than those during years of average, or above average precipitation when the water table would be closer to land surface. Test holes drilled in areas of native vegetation on the northern and eastern sides of Carson Valley had high concentrations of soil chloride at depths ranging from 4 to 18 feet below land surface at six locations on the eastern side of the valley. The high chloride concentrations indicate that modern-day precipitation at the six locations does not percolate deeper than the root zone of native vegetation. Estimates of the time required to accumulate the measured amount of chloride to depths of about 30 feet below land surface at the six test holes ranged from about 3,000 to 12,000 years. Low concentrations of soil chloride in two test holes on the northern end of Carson Valley and in a test hole on the eastern side of Fish Spring Flat indicate that a small amount of recharge from modern-day precipitation is taking place. Estimated annual recharge from precipitation at the two locations was 0.03 and 0.04 foot on the northern end of the valley and 0.02 foot on the eastern side of Fish Spring Flat. Uncertainty in the estimated recharge rates was about ±0.01 foot. Estimates of the time required to accumulate the measured amount of chloride to depths of about 30 feet below land surface at the three test holes ranged from about 100 to 700 years. The two test holes near the northern end of the valley are in gravel and eolian sand deposits and recharge from precipitation may be taking place at similar rates in other areas with gravel and eolian sand deposits. Based on results from other test holes, recharge at the rate estimated for the test hole on the eastern side of Fish Spring Flat is not likely applicable to a large area.},

abstract = {Overhead systems are the dominant irrigation technology in many parts of the world, but they are not widely used in California even though they have higher water application efficiency than furrow irrigation systems and lower labor requirements than drip systems. With water and labor perennial concerns in California, the suitability of overhead systems merits consideration. From 2008 through 2013, in studies near Five Points, California, we evaluated overhead irrigation for wheat, corn, cotton, tomato, onion and broccoli as an alternative to furrow and drip irrigation. With the exception of tomato, equal or increased yields were achieved with overhead irrigation. Many variables are involved in the choice of an irrigation system, but our results suggest that, with more research to support best management practices, overhead irrigation may be useful to a wider set of California farmers than currently use it.},

@article{Snyder2002,
abstract = {Long-term planning for consumptive use (evapotranspiration) by crops is an important activity by the State of California. The information is needed to determine evapotranspiration of applied water (ETaw), which is equal to the seasonal cumulative evapotranspiration minus the initial soil water deficit and the total effective rainfall. This provides an estimate of the net water requirement to irrigate a crop. If the water requirement is divided by the weighted mean application efficiency, the result is a site-specific total irrigation water requirement to produce a crop. For many years, published crop coefficient (Kc) values were used to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from reference evapotranspiration (ETo); however, because the equations for ETo have changed, since the Kc values were developed, they are frequently in error. Also, the published K c values do not adequately account for the influence of rainfall frequency on early or late season ETc nor do they properly account for cover crops. In fact, it is difficult to find references as to how the published Kc values were determined. Based on newly published information on midseason Kc values and on bare soil evaporation, a user-friendly Excel computer program (CUP) was developed to improve long-term estimates and to account for rainfall, cover crop, and immaturity effects on Kc values and ETc. In this paper, the advantages of the new model over traditional long-term ETc estimates and errors in the old estimates will be discussed.},

@article{Shenton2012,
abstract = {There have been significant diversions of water from rivers and streams around the world; natural flow regimes have been perturbed by dams, barriers and excessive extractions. Many aspects of the ecological 'health' of riverine systems have declined due to changes in water flows, which has stimulated the development of thinking about the maintenance and restoration of these systems, which we refer to as environmental flow methodologies (EFMs). Most existing EFMs cannot deliver information on the population viability of species because they: (1) use habitat suitability as a proxy for population status; (2) use historical time series (usually of short duration) to forecast future conditions and flow sequences; (3) cannot, or do not, handle extreme flow events associated with climate variability; and (4) assume process stationarity for flow sequences, which means the past sequences are treated as good indicators of the future. These assumptions undermine the capacity of EFMs to properly represent risks associated with different flow management options; assumption (4) is untenable given most climate-change predictions. We discuss these concerns and advocate the use of demographic modelling as a more appropriate tool for linking population dynamics to flow regime change. A 'meta-species' approach to demographic modelling is discussed as a useful step from habitat based models towards modelling strategies grounded in ecological theory when limited data are available on flow-demographic relationships. Data requirements of demographic models will undoubtedly expose gaps in existing knowledge, but, in so doing, will strengthen future efforts to link changes in river flows with their ecological consequences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Richter1997,
abstract = {1. This paper introduces a new approach for setting streamflow-based river ecosystem management targets and this method is called the 'Range of Variability Approach' (RVA). The proposed approach derives from aquatic ecology theory concerning the critical role of hydrological variability, and associated characteristics of timing, frequency, duration, and rates of change, in sustaining aquatic ecosystems. The method is intended for application on rivers wherein the conservation of native aquatic biodiversity and protection of natural ecosystem functions are primary river management objectives. 2. The RVA uses as its starting point either measured or synthesized daily streamflow values from a period during which human perturbations to the hydrological regime were negligible. This streamflow record is then characterized using thirty-two different hydrological parameters, using methods defined in Richter et al. (1996). Using the RVA, a range of variation in each of the thirty-two parameters, e.g. the values at ± 1 standard deviation from the mean or the twenty-fifth to seventy-fifth percentile range, are selected as initial flow management targets. 3. The RVA targets are intended to guide the design of river management strategies (e.g. reservoir operations rules, catchment restoration) that will lead to attainment of these targets on an annual basis. The RVA will enable river managers to define and adopt readily interim management targets before conclusive, long-term ecosystem research results are available. The RVA targets and management strategies should be adaptively refined as suggested by research results and as needed to sustain native aquatic ecosystem biodiversity and integrity.},

@article{Bunn2002,
abstract = {The flow regime is regarded by many aquatic ecologists to be the key driver of river and floodplain wetland ecosystems. We have focused this literature review around four key principles to highlight the important mechanisms that link hydrology and aquatic biodiversity and to illustrate the consequent impacts of altered flow regimes: Firstly, flow is a major determinant of physical habitat in streams, which in turn is a major determinant of biotic composition; Secondly, aquatic species have evolved life history strategies primarily in direct response to the natural flow regimes; Thirdly, maintenance of natural patterns of longitudinal and lateral connectivity is essential to the viability of populations of many riverine species; Finally, the invasion and success of exotic and introduced species in rivers is facilitated by the alteration of flow regimes. The impacts of flow change are manifest across broad taxonomic groups including riverine plants, invertebrates, and fish. Despite growing recognition of these relationships, ecologists still struggle to predict and quantify biotic responses to altered flow regimes. One obvious difficulty is the ability to distinguish the direct effects of modified flow regimes from impacts associated with land-use change that often accompanies water resource development. Currently, evidence about how rivers function in relation to flow regime and the flows that aquatic organisms need exists largely as a series of untested hypotheses.

abstract = {The minimum viable population (MVP) size has been compared for a wide range of organisms in conservation biology, but a limited number of studies investigated it for freshwater fishes, which exhibit diverse life history strategies. In this study, the MVP size and population growth rate of 36 fish species in the Yangtze River were estimated and compared with their life-history traits. The results indicated that the MVP size ranged from 42 to 320 individuals, and instantaneous per-capita population growth rate ranged from 0.009 to 0.188 per year. MVP size and population growth rate were significantly associated with three life history traits: the age at maturity, generation time, and fecundity. Long-lived species with delayed maturation, long generation time, and high fecundity had a greater MVP size and a lower population growth rate than short-lived species. Therefore, our results emphasize a need for prioritizing our conservation effort more on long-lived species.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 University of California, Oakland. All Rights Reserved. It is well known that California experiences dramatic swings in precipitation that are difficult to predict and challenging to agriculture. In times of drought, groundwater serves as a crucial savings account that is heavily relied upon. However, few tools exist to proactively refill this crucial reserve in wet years. We explored the idea of intentional winter flooding of agricultural land to promote on-farm recharge of the underlying groundwater. Field experiments were conducted on two established alfalfa stands to determine the feasibility of groundwater recharge and test realistic water application amounts and timings and potential crop damage. We studied soils with relatively high percolation rates and found that most of the applied water percolated to the groundwater table, resulting in short-lived saturated conditions in the root zone and minimal yield loss. While caution is appropriate to prevent crop injury, winter recharge in alfalfa fields with highly permeable soils appears to be a viable practice.},

abstract = {We developed stochastic matrix models to evaluate the effects of hydrologic alteration and variable mortality on the population dynamics of a lotie fish in a regulated river system. Models were applied to a representative lotic fish species, the flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), for which two populations were examined: a native population from a regulated reach of the Coosa River (Alabama, USA) and an introduced population from an unregulated section of the Ocmulgee River (Georgia, USA). Size-classified matrix models were constructed for both populations, and residuals from catch-curve regressions were used as indices of year class strength (i.e., recruitment). A multiple regression model indicated that recruitment of flathead catfish in the Coosa River was positively related to the frequency of spring pulses between 283 and 566 m3/s. For the Ocmulgee River population, multiple regression models indicated that year class strength was negatively related to mean March discharge and positively related to June low flow. When the Coosa population was modeled to experience five consecutive years of favorable hydrologic conditions during a 50-year projection period, it exhibited a substantial spike in size and increased at an overall 0.2{\%} annual rate. When modeled to experience five years of unfavorable hydrologic conditions, the Coosa population initially exhibited a decrease in size but later stabilized and increased at a 0.4{\%} annual rate following the decline. When the Ocmulgee River population was modeled to experience five years of favorable conditions, it exhibited a substantial spike in size and increased at an overall 0.4{\%} annual rate. After the Ocmulgee population experienced five years of unfavorable conditions, a sharp decline in population size was predicted. However, the population quickly recovered, with population size increasing at a 0.3{\%} annual rate following the decline. In general, stochastic population growth in the Ocmulgee River was more erratic and variable than population growth in the Coosa River. We encourage ecologists to develop similar models for other lotic species, particularly in regulated river systems. Successful management of fish populations in regulated systems requires that we are able to predict how hydrology affects recruitment and will ultimately influence the population dynamics of fishes. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Restoration activities in the Central Valley of California and elsewhere require accurate evapotranspiration information, which can then be used for a wide variety of surface and subsurface hydrologic evaluations. However, directly measuring evapotranspiration can be difficult or impossible depending on the evaluation's time frame. Transferability of measured evapotranspiration in time and space is also necessary but typically requires a weather-based reference. For nonagricultural vegetation, there is at present time no standard reference, which makes the evaluation of a variety of vegetation types from different sources difficult and time-consuming. This paper examines several methods used to estimate evapotranspiration from native vegetation, including the use of vegetation coefficients (Kv). Vegetation coefficients are based on a standardized reference and are computed as the ratio of vegetation evapotranspiration (ETv) to the grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo). These monthly Kv values are used to compute the long-term (for this study, 1922-2009) average ETv for vegetation types documented to exist in California's Central Valley prior to the arrival of the first European settlers in the mid-18th century. For vegetation that relies on precipitation and soil moisture storage, a calibrated daily soil-water balance with a dual crop coefficient approach was used to compute evapotranspiration regionally over the time frame.},

The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) of 2014 seeks to maintain groundwater discharge to streams to support environmental goals. In Scott Valley, in Siskiyou County, the Scott River and its tributaries are an important salmonid spawning habitat, and about 10{\%} of average annual Scott River stream flow comes from groundwater. The local groundwater advisory committee is developing groundwater management alternatives that would increase summer and early fall stream flows. We developed a model to provide a framework to evaluate those alternatives. We first created a water budget for the Scott Valley groundwater basin and integrated the detailed, spatiotemporally distributed water budget results into a computer model of the basin that simultaneously accounted for groundwater flow, stream flow and landscape water fluxes. Different conceptual representations (using the MODFLOW RIV package and MODFLOW SFR package) of the stream–aquifer boundary provided significantly different results in the seasonal dynamics of groundwater–surface water fluxes. As groundwater sustainability agencies draw up plans to meet SGMA requirements, they must choose and test simulation tools carefully.},

@article{Asarian2016,
abstract = {Using streamflow data from the U.S. Geological Survey, we assessed long-term (1953-2012) trends in streamflow on California's North Coast including many sites in the redwood region. The study area spans from the Smith River to the Mattole River and includes the Eel and Klamath-Trinity basins. Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) is a time-weighted summary of precipitation which provides high weight to recent precipitation and low weight to precipitation that occurred many months ago. We used a regression model of the relationship between API and streamflow to calculate “precipitation-adjusted streamflow”, which statistically reduced the year-to-year fluctuations caused by variable precipitation and allowed evaluation of the underlying streamflow trend. During the summer and early fall, streamflow and precipitation-adjusted streamflow have significantly declined in recent decades in many streams. With the exception of precipitation quantity, the methods used in this analysis do not allow individual quantification of the factors contributing to streamflow declines. However, the long-term streamflow gages include a diverse range of watershed and climate conditions. Thus, we can hypothesize about causal mechanisms by carefully examining the trends that have occurred in watersheds with different conditions and histories. The most pristine surface-runoff dominated watersheds within the study area showed no decreases in precipitation-adjusted streamflow during the summer months. This suggests that streamflow decreases at other sites are more likely the result of increased water withdrawals and/or changes in vegetation structure/composition than climate factors other than precipitation quantity (e.g., decreased fog and increased air temperature). Our results appear to support the hypothesis that water withdrawals are an important factor, but not the only one, contributing to the declining trends in precipitation-adjusted streamflows. There were few declines in those watersheds with the least amount of diversions. Because evapotranspiration is such a large portion of the annual water budget, small changes in evapotranspiration have the potential for large effects on summer streamflows. The North Coast's forests have undergone substantial changes in the past century as a result of timber harvest and fire suppression. Without fire or mechanical intervention, Douglas-fir trees are invading prairies and oak woodlands, potentially increasing evapotranspiration. Young dense forests within the region may be in a state of maximum evapotranspiration. Bull Creek (tributary to the South Fork Eel River) provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that vegetation change is contributing to streamflow declines, because despite lacking water diversions it had among the largest declines in precipitation-adjusted streamflow, coinciding with the regeneration of its forests following intensive logging that occurred prior to installation of the stream gage in 1960.},

Agriculture's main challenge for the coming decades will be to produce sufficient food and fiber for a growing global population at an acceptable environmental cost. This challenge requires an ecological approach to agriculture that is largely missing from current management and research portfolios. Crop and livestock production systems must be managed as ecosystems, with management decisions fully informed of environmental costs and benefits. Currently, too little is known about important ecological interactions in major agricultural systems and landscapes and about the economic value of the ecosystem services associated with agriculture. To create agricultural landscapes that are managed for multiple services in addition to food and fiber will require integrative research, both ecological and socioeconomic, as well as policy innovation and public education. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The flow regime is a primary determinant of the structure and function of aquatic and riparian ecosystems for streams and rivers. Hydrologic alteration has impaired riverine ecosystems on a global scale, and the pace and intensity of human development greatly exceeds the ability of scientists to assess the effects on a river-by-river basis. Current scientific understanding of hydrologic controls on riverine ecosystems and experience gained from individual river studies support development of environmental flow standards at the regional scale. 2. This paper presents a consensus view from a group of international scientists on a new framework for assessing environmental flow needs for many streams and rivers simultaneously to foster development and implementation of environmental flow standards at the regional scale. This framework, the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration (ELOHA), is a synthesis of a number of existing hydrologic techniques and environmental flow methods that are currently being used to various degrees and that can support comprehensive regional flow management. The flexible approach allows scientists, water-resource managers and stakeholders to analyse and synthesise available scientific information into ecologically based and socially acceptable goals and standards for management of environmental flows. 3. The ELOHA framework includes the synthesis of existing hydrologic and ecological databases from many rivers within a user-defined region to develop scientifically defensible and empirically testable relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses. These relationships serve as the basis for the societally driven process of developing regional flow standards. This is to be achieved by first using hydrologic modelling to build a 'hydrologic foundation' of baseline and current hydrographs for stream and river segments throughout the region. Second, using a set of ecologically relevant flow variables, river segments within the region are classified into a few distinctive flow regime types that are expected to have different ecological characteristics. These river types can be further subclassified according to important geomorphic features that define hydraulic habitat features. Third, the deviation of current-condition flows from baseline-condition flow is determined. Fourth, flow alteration-ecological response relationships are developed for each river type, based on a combination of existing hydroecological literature, expert knowledge and field studies across gradients of hydrologic alteration. 4. Scientific uncertainty will exist in the flow alteration-ecological response relationships, in part because of the confounding of hydrologic alteration with other important environmental determinants of river ecosystem condition (e.g. temperature). Application of the ELOHA framework should therefore occur in a consensus context where stakeholders and decision-makers explicitly evaluate acceptable risk as a balance between the perceived value of the ecological goals, the economic costs involved and the scientific uncertainties in functional relationships between ecological responses and flow alteration. 5. The ELOHA framework also should proceed in an adaptive management context, where collection of monitoring data or targeted field sampling data allows for testing of the proposed flow alteration-ecological response relationships. This empirical validation process allows for a fine-tuning of environmental flow management targets. The ELOHA framework can be used both to guide basic research in hydroecology and to further implementation of more comprehensive environmental flow management of freshwater sustainability on a global scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Ecological limits of hydrological alteration (ELOHA) framework aims to set limits of hydrologic alteration based on empirical hydroecological relationships built along flow impairment gradients. These relationships can be specific for different natural flow regime types. The object of our study is testing the ELOHA method in the Ebro River Basin. Seven flow alteration–ecological response curves were obtained in the present study as preliminary guidelines for developing and calibrating environmental flow standards in the Ebro River Basin. For continental Mediterranean-pluvial flow regime mean monthly flow in March was related to Plecoptera abundance (ELOHAs ±21{\%} from baseline), and high flow magnitude and frequency were closely related to Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera richness (ELOHAs for high flow magnitude and frequency were +18 and +54{\%} the reference central value respectively). For nivo-pluvial flow regime, high flow magnitude was found indicative of macroinvertebrate biodiversity and Coleoptera abundance (ELOHAS −12 and +23{\%} from central reference value respectively). And for pluvio-oceanic flow regime, mean monthly flow in January was indicative of the proportion of Gastropoda, Oligochaeta and Diptera taxa (GOLD index) (ELOHA +17{\%} from baseline). These hydrological limits are endorsed by recent international reference works. Flow alteration–ecological relationships presented here were constructed from real monthly flow data records and macroinvertebrate samples at family level. ELOHA values obtained in this study pretend to be a starting point for implementing an environmental flow regime program in the Ebro River Basin.

abstract = {One of the most widely applied methodologies for developing instream flow recommendations is the instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM) and its component microhabitat model, physical habitat simulation (PHABSIM). In this paper we reviewed over 1,500 habitat-flow curves obtained from 127 PHABSIM studies from western North America to develop predictions for flow needs for salmonids in this region and to test whether habitat-flow relationships for salmonids were related to watershed characteristics and geographic location. We present regressions that predict PHABSIM optima for four life history stages of four salmonid species and for all salmonid species in the database as a group, and we quantify the uncertainty in these estimates. Mean annual discharge (MAD) was the best predictor of optimum flow. The general form of the regressions was loge(optimum flow) = A × loge(MAD), where A {\textless} 1. Minor improvement in predictive power was sometimes possible with addition of latitude and longitude coordinates to the regression. This relationship is asymptotic and differs considerably from the fixed flow percentages recommended by Tennant. Our results are presented as a planning tool to (1) allow managers and project proponents to conduct a preliminary assessment of proposed water-use development projects, (2) optimize research efforts for instream flow studies and experiments, and (3) set experimental boundaries for adaptive management of stream flow.},

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

abstract = {This report documents a Newton formulation of MODFLOW-2005, called MODFLOW-NWT. MODFLOW- NWT is a standalone program that is intended for solving problems involving drying and rewetting nonlinearities of the unconfined groundwater-flow equation. MODFLOW- NWT must be used with the Upstream-Weighting (UPW) Package for calculating intercell conductances in a different manner than is done in the Block-Centered Flow (BCF), Layer Property Flow (LPF), or Hydrogeologic-Unit Flow (HUF; Anderman and Hill, 2000) Packages. TheUPW Package treats nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting by use of a continuous function of groundwater head, rather than the discrete approach of drying and rewetting that is used by the BCF, LPF, and HUF Packages. This further enables application of the Newton formulation for unconfined groundwater-flow problems because conductance derivatives required by the Newton method are smooth over the full range of head for a model cell. The NWT linearization approach generates an asymmetric matrix, which is different from the standard MODFLOW formulation that generates a symmetric matrix. Because all linear solvers presently available for use with MODFLOW-2005 solve only symmetric matrices, MODFLOW-NWT includes two previously developed asymmetric matrix-solver options. The matrix-solver options include a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES) Solver and an Orthomin / stabilized conjugate-gradient (CGSTAB) Solver. The GMRES Solver is documented in a previously published report, such that only a brief description and input instructions are provided in this report. However, the CGSTAB Solver (called $\chi$MD) is documented in this report. Flow-property input for the UPW Package is designed based on the LPF Package and material-property input is identical to that for the LPF Package except that the rewetting and vertical-conductance correction options of the LPF Package are not available with the UPW Package. Input files constructed for the LPF Package can be used with slight modification as input for the UPW Package. This report presents the theory and methods used by MODFLOW-NWT,including the UPW Package. Additionally, this report provides comparisons of the new methodology to analytical solutions of groundwater flow and to standard MODFLOW-2005 results by use of an unconfined aquifer MODFLOW example problem. The standard MODFLOW-2005 simulation uses the LPF Package with the wet/dry option active. A new example problem also is presented to demonstrate MODFLOW- NWT's ability to provide a solution for a difficult unconfined groundwater-flow problem.},

abstract = {Resource managers have traditionally had to rely on simple hydrological and habitat-association methods to predict how changes in river flow regimes will affect the viability of instream populations and communities. Yet these systems are characterized by dynamic feedbacks among system components, a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, and connectivity between habitats, none of which can be adequately captured in the commonly employed management methods. We argue that process-oriented ecological models, which consider dynamics across scales and levels of biological organization, are better suited to guide flow regime management. We review how ecological dynamics in streams and rivers are shaped by a combination of the flow regime and internal feedbacks, and proceed to describe ecological modeling tools that have the potential to characterize such dynamics. We conclude with a suggested research agenda to facilitate the inclusion of ecological dynamics into instream flow needs assessments. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

@article{Dulvy2003,
abstract = {Human impacts on the world's oceans have been substantial, leading to concerns about the extinction of marine taxa. We have compiled 133 local, regional and global extinctions of marine populations. There is typically a 53-year lag between the last sighting of an organism and the reported date of the extinction at whatever scale this has occurred. Most disappearances (80{\%}) were detected using indirect historical comparative methods, which suggests that marine extinctions may have been underestimated because of low-detection power. Exploitation caused most marine losses at various scales (55{\%}), followed closely by habitat loss (37{\%}), while the remainder were linked to invasive species, climate change, pollution and disease. Several perceptions concerning the vulnerability of marine organisms appear to be too general and insufficiently conservative. Marine species cannot be considered less vulnerable on the basis of biological attributes such as high fecundity or large-scale dispersal characteristics. For commercially exploited species, it is often argued that economic extinction of exploited populations will occur before biological extinction, but this is not the case for non-target species caught in multispecies fisheries or species with high commercial value, especially if this value increases as species become rare. The perceived high potential for recovery, high variability and low extinction vulnerability of fish populations have been invoked to avoid listing commercial species of fishes under international threat criteria. However, we need to learn more about recovery, which may be hampered by negative population growth at small population sizes (Allee effect or depensation) or ecosystem shifts, as well as about spatial dynamics and connectivity of subpopulations before we can truly understand the nature of responses to severe depletions. The evidence suggests that fish populations do not fluctuate more than those of mammals, birds and butterflies, and that fishes may exhibit vulnerability similar to mammals, birds and butterflies. There is an urgent need for improved methods of detecting marine extinctions at various spatial scales, and for predicting the vulnerability of species.},

abstract = {The term "environmental flows" describes the quantities, quality, and patterns of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. Environmental flows may be achieved in a number of different ways, most of which are based on either (1) limiting alterations from the natural flow baseline to maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity or (2) designing flow regimes to achieve specific ecological and ecosystem service outcomes. We argue that the former practice is more applicable to natural and semi-natural rivers where the primary objective and opportunity is ecological conservation. The latter "designer" approach is better suited to modified and managed rivers where return to natural conditions is no longer feasible and the objective is to maximize natural capital as well as support economic growth, recreation, or cultural history. This permits elements of ecosystem design and adaptation to environmental change. In a future characterized by altered climates and intensive regulation, where hybrid and novel aquatic ecosystems predominate, the designer approach may be the only feasible option. This conclusion stems from a lack of natural ecosystems from which to draw analogs and the need to support broader socioeconomic benefits and valuable configurations of natural and social capital.},

abstract = {This case study was developed as part of a larger, interdisciplinary research project to assess the social, hydrological, and ecological effects of beaver-related watershed restoration approaches in rangeland streams of the Western United States. It is one of five case studies being undertaken to investigate the social context of beaver-related restoration in western rangelands. The Scott River basin in northern California is the first place in the state where watershed restoration using beaver dam analogues (BDAs, instream post and vegetation-weave structures that mimic natural beaver dams) has been tried. The project takes place on private lands and in streams where federal Endangered Species Act-listed southern Oregon/northern California coast coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) spawn and rear in fresh water before migrating out to the ocean. It started in 2014 as an initiative of a local community group, the Scott River Watershed Council, with technical support from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist. Project goals include improving instream habitat for coho salmon to promote population recovery, improving surface water flows, raising groundwater levels, reducing stream channel incision, and demonstrating the value of BDAs as a restoration tool in California. To date, 10 BDA structures have been built at five sites on streams running through private property in the Scott River basin, and more are planned. Beavers have been active, or have taken over maintenance of BDAs, at all sites. Because this is the first project in California to use this restoration approach, and because the BDAs are being built in critical fish habitat, the project has been undertaken on an experimental basis. It has entailed a large learning curve on the part of the Scott River Watershed Council and federal and state regulatory agencies, but over time the regulatory process for permitting BDAs has gotten easier, and stakeholders are working together to collectively find solutions to ongoing BDA-related challenges. Most of the private landowners involved are ranchers who also grow hay, and who have largely positive views of beavers and beaver dams, so long as they do not interfere with irrigation infrastructure. Monitoring data and interviews with stakeholders indicate that the BDAs are starting to achieve their goals, and are benefitting both landowners and fish, although impacts are localized because the project remains small in scale owing to its experimental status. The Scott Valley case offers important lessons learned for undertaking beaver-related restoration in a private lands context.},

abstract = {The socioeconomic monitoring report addresses two evaluation questions posed in the Northwest Forest Plan (the Plan) Record of Decision and assesses progress in meeting five Plan socioeconomic goals. Volume I of the report contains key findings. Volume II addresses the question, Are predictable levels of timber and nontimber resources available and being produced? It also evaluates progress in meeting the goal of producing a predictable level of timber sales, special forest products, livestock grazing, minerals, and recreation opportunities. The focus of volume III is the evaluation question, Are local communities and economies experiencing positive or negative changes that may be associated with federal forest management? Two Plan goals are also assessed in volume III: (1) to maintain the stability of local and regional economies on a predictable, long-term basis and, (2) to assist with long-term economic development and diversification to minimize adverse impacts associated with the loss of timber jobs. Progress in meeting another Plan goal - to promote agency-citizen collaboration in forest management - is evaluated in volume IV. Volume V reports on trends in public values regarding forest management in the Pacific Northwest over the past decade, community views of how well the forest values and environmental qualities associated with late-successional, old-growth, and aquatic ecosystems have been protected under the Plan (a fifth Plan goal), and issues and concerns relating to forest management under the Plan expressed by community members. Volume VI provides a history of the Northwest Forest Plan socioeconomic monitoring program and a discussion of potential directions for the program.},

abstract = {Since the 1940s, snow water equivalent (SWE) has decreased throughout the Pacific Northwest, while water use has increased. Climate has been proposed as the primary cause of base-flow decline in the Scott River, an important coho salmon rearing tributary in the Klamath Basin. We took a comparative-basin approach to estimating the relative contributions of climatic and non-climatic factors to this decline. We used permutation tests to compare discharge in 5 streams and 16 snow courses between "historic" (1942-1976) and "modern" (1977-2005) time periods, defined by cool and warm phases, respectively, of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. April 1 SWE decreased significantly at most snow courses lower than 1,800 in in elevation and increased slightly at higher elevations. Correspondingly, base flow decreased significantly in the two streams with the lowest latitude-adjusted elevation and increased slightly in two higher-elevation streams. Base-flow decline in the Scott River, the only study stream heavily utilized for irrigation, was larger than that in all other streams and larger than predicted by elevation. Based on comparison with a neighboring stream draining wilderness, we estimate that 39{\%} of the observed 10 Mm(3) decline in July 1-October 22 discharge in the Scott River is explained by regional-scale climatic factors. The remainder of the decline is attributable to local factors, which include an increase in irrigation withdrawal from 48 to 103 Mm(3)/year since the 1950s.},

abstract = {With the widespread decline and endangerment of freshwater fishes, there is a need to clearly define habitat requirements for effective species management and habitat restoration. Fish biologists often infer habitat requirements on the basis of correlative habitat associations in the wild. This generates descriptive models that predict species presence or abundance at a hierarchy of scales: distributional (macrohabitat) models predict the presence/absence of species at large scales, capacity models predict the abundance at the reach or channel unit scale when a species is present, and microhabitat models predict the distribution of individual fish at smaller spatial scales (e.g., instream habitat suitability curves for velocity, depth, and substrate). However, relationships based on habitat associations in the wild rarely give definitive insight into the absolute requirement for a particular habitat (i.e., necessity of a habitat for the persistence of individuals and populations). The assumption that habitat selection accurately reflects the fitness consequences of habitat use is rarely validated; more rigorous assessment of habitat requirement usually involves manipulative experiments or measurements of fitness (individual growth, survival, or reproductive success) in different habitat types. Bioenergetic habitat models offer a promising mechanistic alternative to correlative habitat suitability models for drift-feeding fish and have the potential to predict habitat-specific growth rates on the basis of swimming costs and energy intake. Once smaller-scale habitat requirements of individuals are well defined, the final step is to determine when and how the requirements of individuals limit populations. Extrapolating smaller-scale habitat requirements to the population level requires either large-scale (ecosystem) manipulations of habitat, adaptive management, or habitat-explicit population models. For species with distinct ontogenic shifts in habitat requirements, the concept of optimal habitat ratios may be useful for identifying limiting habitat factors and defining baselines for habitat restoration. Defining optimal habitat configurations for different species may also provide a basis for predicting how habitat change differentially affects species with contrasting habitat needs.},

abstract = {Accurately identifying the position of vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kv) contrasts is critical to the delineation of hydrogeologic units that serve as the basis for conceptual and numerical models of groundwater flow. High resolution head profiles have identified the position and thickness of Kv contrasts in clayey aquitards but this potential has not yet been thoroughly evaluated in sedimentary rocks. This paper describes an experiment in which head profiles with the highest, technically feasible resolution were obtained using Westbay{\textregistered} multilevel systems (MLS) installed in 15 cored holes at three sedimentary rock research sites with contrasting geologic and flow system conditions. MLSs were installed to maximum depths between 90 and 260m with 2-5 monitoring zones per 10m. Head profiles were measured over multiyear periods. The vertical component of hydraulic gradient (i.e., vertical gradient) was calculated for each pair of adjacent monitoring intervals in every MLS and then categorized based on its repeatability to facilitate interpretation of Kv contrasts and comparisons within boreholes, between boreholes at the same site, and between sites. The head and vertical gradient profiles from all three sites display systematic (i.e., simple, geometric) shapes defined by repeatable intervals of no to minimal vertical gradient, indicating relatively high Kv units, bounded by shorter depth intervals with large (up to -50m/m) vertical gradients, indicating relatively low Kv units. The systematic nature of the profiles suggests flow in regular and interconnected fracture networks rather than dominated by a few key fractures with irregular orientations. The low Kv units were typically thin, with their positions and thicknesses not predicted by lithostratigraphy or detailed lithologic, geophysical, and horizontal hydraulic conductivity data. Hence, the position and thickness of units with contrasting Kv would not be evident if MLSs with the conventional number of monitoring zones had been used. Furthermore, the detailed profiles can be strongly diagnostic of hydrogeologic unit boundaries or layers and can be used to improve the quantitative assessment of flow system conditions that is foundational to understanding contaminant plume migration.},

abstract = {Aim: Many factors facilitate biological invasions, making it difficult to determine their relative importance, especially when relying on survey data that include confounded variables. Incorporating information about species characteristics can improve inferences drawn from species-environment relationships, which can inform management. We seek to understand why the abundance of exotic, and not native, terrestrial plants is higher in riparian wetlands most impacted by flow regulation. Location: River Murray, SE Australia. Methods: We use variance components analysis and hierarchical generalised linear models to examine whether the positive relationship between flow regulation and proportional cover of exotic plants is driven by altered hydrological regimes, wetland drying and drought, superior colonisation ability of exotic species following disturbance or human-increased propagule pressure. Results: Of the four hypotheses, hydrological modification (indicated by flood magnitude) most likely drives invasion. Flow regulation may inhibit native species adapted to the historical hydrological regime, facilitating exotic species with different environmental ranges. A symptom of environmental change, invasion may have been exacerbated by drought, although it is unclear why. There was no indication that human-increased propagule pressure or colonisation ability facilitated invasion. Exotic cover was unrelated to proximity to towns, recent flood frequency and cattle grazing intensity. Additionally, similar proportions of exotic and native species were used in cultivation and, despite a higher proportion of exotics being known weeds, weed status was unrelated to exotic species occupancy. Overall, colonisation ability was unrelated to species' origin or response to water depth and hydrological change. Although exotics had higher specific leaf area and shorter longevity (indicative of higher colonisation ability), they had heavier (not lighter) seeds and did not differ in height from natives. Main conclusions: Using environmental flows to reinstate mid-range floods and augmenting the propagule supply of native species with characteristics suitable for modified conditions may help limit invasion in these wetlands. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {In recent years, climate model experiments have been increasingly oriented toward providing information that can support local and regional adaptation to the expected impacts of anthropogenic climate change. This shift has magnified the importance of downscaling as a means to translate coarse-scale global climate model (GCM) output to a finer scale that more closely matches the scale of interest. Applying this technique, however, introduces a new source of uncertainty into any resulting climate model ensemble. Here a method is presented, on the basis of a previously established variance decomposition method, to partition and quantify the uncertainty in climate model ensembles that is attributable to downscaling. The method is applied to the southeastern United States using five downscaled datasets that represent both statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques. The combined ensemble is highly fragmented, in that only a small portion of the complete set of downscaled GCMs and emission scenarios is typically available. The results indicate that the uncertainty attributable to downscaling approaches ;20{\%} for large areas of the Southeast for precipitation and ;30{\%} for extreme heat days (.358C) in the Appalachian Mountains. However, attributable quantities are significantly lower for time periods when the full ensemble is considered but only a subsample of all models is available, suggesting that overconfidence could be a serious problem in studies that employ a single set of downscaled GCMs. This article concludes with recommendations to advance the design of climate model experiments so that the uncertainty that accrues when downscaling is employed is more fully and systematically considered.},

abstract = {Sierra Nevada climate and snowpack is simulated during the period of extreme drought from 2011 to 2015 and compared to an identical simulation except for the removal of the twentieth century anthropogenic warming. Anthropogenic warming reduced average snowpack levels by 25{\%}, with middle-to-low elevations experiencing reductions between 26 and 43{\%}. In terms of event frequency, return periods associated with anomalies in 4 year 1 April snow water equivalent are estimated to have doubled, and possibly quadrupled, due to past warming. We also estimate effects of future anthropogenic warmth on snowpack during a drought similar to that of 2011–2015. Further snowpack declines of 60–85{\%} are expected, depending on emissions scenario. The return periods associated with future snowpack levels are estimated to range from millennia to much longer. Therefore, past human emissions of greenhouse gases are already negatively impacting statewide water resources during drought, and much more severe impacts are likely to be inevitable.},

The new packages provide flexibility in simulating evapo- transpiration and drain features not provided by the MODFLOW-2000 Evapotranspiration (EVT) and Drain (DRN) Packages. The report describes conceptualization of the packages, input instructions, list- ings and explanations of the source code, and example simulations. The new Evapotranspiration Segments (ETS1) Package allows simulation of evapotranspiration with a user-defined relation between evapotranspiration rate and hydraulic head. This capability provides a degree of flexibility not supported by the EVT Package, which has been available in MODFLOW since its initial release. In the ETS1 Package, the relation of evapotranspiration rate to hydraulic head is conceptualized as a segmented line between an evaporation surface, defined as the elevation where the evapotranspiration rate reaches a maximum, and an elevation located at an extinc- tion depth below the evaporation surface, where the evapotranspiration rate reaches zero. The user supplies input to define as many intermediate segment endpoints as desired to define the relation of evapotranspiration rate to head between these two elevations. The EVT Package, in contrast, simulates evapotranspiration with a single linear function. The new Drain Return (DRT1) Package can be used to simulate the return flow of water discharged from a drain feature back into the ground-water system. The DRN Package, which has been available in MODFLOWsince its initial release, does not have the capability to simulate return of flow. If the return-flow option of the DRT1 Package is selected, for each cell designated as a drain-return cell, the user has the option of specifying a proportion of the water simulated as leaving the ground-water system through the drain feature that is to be simulated as returning simultaneously to one other cell in the model.},

Current trends point to continued human population growth and ever higher levels of consumption as the global economy expands. This will stress the capacity of agriculture to meet food needs without further sacrificing the environmental integrity of local landscapes and the global environment. Agriculture's main challenge for the coming decades will be to produce sufficient food and fiber for a growing global population at an acceptable environmental cost. This challenge requires an ecological approach to agriculture that is largely missing from current management and research portfolios. Crop and livestock production systems must be managed as ecosystems, with management decisions fully informed of environmental costs and benefits. Currently, too little is known about important ecological interactions in major agricultural systems and landscapes and about the economic value of the ecosystem services associated with agriculture. To create agricultural landscapes that are managed for multiple services in addition to food and fiber will require integrative research, both ecological and socioeconomic, as well as policy innovation and public education. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Intensive groundwater withdrawals in California have resulted in depletion of streams and aquifers in some regions. Agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) initiatives have recently been piloted in California to mitigate the effects of unsustainable groundwater withdrawals. These initiatives rely on capturing wet-year water and spreading it on large areas of irrigated agricultural lands to enhance recharge to aquifers. While recharge studies typically consider local effects on aquifer storage, few studies have investigated Ag-MAR benefits and challenges at a regional scale. Here we used the Integrated Water Flow Model, to evaluate how Ag-MAR projects can affect streamflows, diversions, pumping, and unsaturated zone flows in the southern Central Valley, California. We further tested the sensitivity of three different spatial patterns of Ag-MAR, each chosen based on different thresholds of soil suitability, on the hydrologic system. This study investigates how the distribution of Ag-MAR lands benefit the regional groundwater system and other water balance components. The results suggest that Ag-MAR benefits vary as a function of the location of Ag-MAR lands. Stream-aquifer interactions play a crucial factor in determining the ability to increase groundwater storage in overdrafted basins. The results also indicate that Ag-MAR projects conducted during the November–April recharge season have implications for water rights outside of the Ag-MAR season. If not properly monitored, Ag-MAR can cause a rise of groundwater table into the root zone, negatively impacting sensitive crops. Our work also highlights the benefits of using an integrated hydrologic and management model to evaluate Ag-MAR at a regional scale.},

The localized constructed analogs (LOCA) method produces downscaled estimates suitable for hydrological simulations using a multiscale spatial matching scheme to pick appropriate analog days from observations. First, a pool of candidate observed analog days is chosen by matching the model field to be downscaled to observed days over the region that is positively correlated with the point being downscaled, which leads to a natural independence of the downscaling results to the extent of the domain being downscaled. Then, the one candidate analog day that best matches in the local area around the grid cell being downscaled is the single analog day used there.

abstract = {Place-based data is required in wildfire analyses, particularly in regions of diverse terrain that foster not only strong gradients in meteorological variables, but also complex fire behaviour. However, a majority of downscaling methods are inappropriate for wildfire application due to the lack of daily timescales and variables such as humidity and winds that are important for fuel flammability and fire spread. Two statistical downscaling methods, the daily Bias corrected Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) and the Multivariate Adapted Constructed Analogs (MACA) that directly incorporate daily data from global climate models, were validated over the western US using global reanalysis data. While both methods outperformed results obtained from direct interpolation from reanalysis, MACA exhibited additional skill in temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation due to its ability to jointly downscale temperature and dew point temperature, and its use of analog patterns rather than interpolation. Both downscaling methods exhibited value added information in tracking fire danger indices and periods of extreme fire danger; however, MACA outperformed the daily BCSD due to its ability to more accurately capture relative humidity and winds.

abstract = {Models which solve the governing groundwater flow or solute transport equations in conjunction with optimization techniques, such as linear and quadratic programing, are powerful aquifer management tools. Groundwater management models fall in two general categories: hydraulics or policy evaluation and water allocation. Groundwater hydraulic management models enable the determination of optimal locations and pumping rates of numerous wells under a variety of restrictions placed upon local drawdown, hydraulic gradients, and water production targets. Groundwater policy evaluation and allocation models can be used to study the influence upon regional groundwater use of institutional policies such as taxes and quotas. Furthermore, fairly complex groundwater‐surface water allocation problems can be handled using system decomposition and multilevel optimization. Experience from the few real world applications of groundwater optimization‐management techniques is summarized. Classified separately are methods for groundwater quality management aimed at optimal waste disposal in the subsurface. This classification is composed of steady state and transient management models that determine disposal patterns in such a way that water quality is protected at supply locations. Classes of research missing from the literature are groundwater quality management models involving nonlinear constraints, models which join groundwater hydraulic and quality simulations with political‐economic management considerations, and management models that include parameter uncertainty.

abstract = {Fragmentation and interconnection of water bodies cause severe changes in the natural flow regime of continental water systems. However, assessments of these impacts on the freshwater fish distribution are still scarce. We investigated whether an artificial flow regime generated by discharges from an aqueduct would promote a longitudinal environmental gradient in an off-river reservoir. We tested the hypothesis that the incoming water from aqueduct discharges promotes environmental gradient between lotic and lentic conditions. We expect that environmental changes and the artificial flow regime promote the structuring of fish assemblage and that the lotic-lentic transition areas present the highest fish species richness. A longitudinal gradient in environmental characteristics with differing fish assemblage structure was found. Temporal changes in the fish assemblages occurred only in areas near the discharge of the aqueduct. The highest fish richness and diversity were recorded in the transition zone during the wet season, associated with the greater environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone, whereas the lowest was found in the lotic zone, probably associated with the altered flow regime. The greatest abundance was recorded in the upper lentic zone in the wet season, whereas the lowest was found in the lower lentic zone in both seasons. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that the artificial flow regime, modulated by the seasonality of discharges and the influence of environmental variables, promotes longitudinal gradients in reservoirs when rivers are not present. The findings are relevant in a scenario where ever more interconnections of aquatic bodies have been diffused around the world.},

abstract = {The flow regime is regarded by many aquatic ecologists to be the key driver of river and floodplain wetland ecosystems. We have focused this literature review around four key principles to highlight the important mechanisms that link hydrology and aquatic biodiversity and to illustrate the consequent impacts of altered flow regimes: Firstly, flow is a major determinant of physical habitat in streams, which in turn is a major determinant of biotic composition; Secondly, aquatic species have evolved life history strategies primarily in direct response to the natural flow regimes; Thirdly, maintenance of natural patterns of longitudinal and lateral connectivity is essential to the viability of populations of many riverine species; Finally, the invasion and success of exotic and introduced species in rivers is facilitated by the alteration of flow regimes. The impacts of flow change are manifest across broad taxonomic groups including riverine plants, invertebrates, and fish. Despite growing recognition of these relationships, ecologists still struggle to predict and quantify biotic responses to altered flow regimes. One obvious difficulty is the ability to distinguish the direct effects of modified flow regimes from impacts associated with land-use change that often accompanies water resource development. Currently, evidence about how rivers function in relation to flow regime and the flows that aquatic organisms need exists largely as a series of untested hypotheses. To overcome these problems, aquatic science needs to move quickly into a manipulative or experimental phase, preferably with the aims of restoration and measuring ecosystem response.},

abstract = {There is a scientific consensus regarding the reality of anthropogenic climate change. This has led to substantial efforts to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions and thereby mitigate the impacts of climate change on a global scale. Despite these efforts, we are committed to substantial further changes over at least the next few decades. Societies will therefore have to adapt to changes in climate. Both adaptation and mitigation require action on scales ranging from local to global, but adaptation could directly benefit from climate predictions on regional scales while mitigation could be driven solely by awareness of the global problem; regional projections being principally of motivational value. We discuss how recent developments of large ensembles of climate model simulations can be interpreted to provide information on these scales and to inform societal decisions. Adaptation is most relevant as an influence on decisions which exist irrespective of climate change, but which have consequences on decadal time-scales. Even in such situations, climate change is often only a minor influence; perhaps helping to restrict the choice of 'no regrets' strategies. Nevertheless, if climate models are to provide inputs to societal decisions, it is important to interpret them appropriately. We take climate ensembles exploring model uncertainty as potentially providing a lower bound on the maximum range of uncertainty and thus a non-discountable climate change envelope. An analysis pathway is presented, describing how this information may provide an input to decisions, sometimes via a number of other analysis procedures and thus a cascade of uncertainty. An initial screening is seen as a valuable component of this process, potentially avoiding unnecessary effort while guiding decision makers through issues of confidence and robustness in climate modelling information. Our focus is the usage of decadal to centennial time-scale climate change simulations as inputs to decision making, but we acknowledge that robust adaptation to the variability of present day climate encourages the development of less vulnerable systems as well as building critical experience in how to respond to climatic uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Analyses of observed non-Gaussian daily minimum and maximum temperature probability distribution functions (PDFs) in the Southwest US highlight the importance of variance and warm tail length in determining future heat wave probability. Even if no PDF shape change occurs with climate change, locations with shorter warm tails and/or smaller variance will see a greater increase in heat wave probability, defined as exceedances above the historical 95th percentile threshold, than will long tailed/larger variance distributions. Projections from ten downscaled CMIP5 models show important geospatial differences in the amount of warming expected for a location. However, changes in heat wave probability do not directly follow changes in background warming. Projected changes in heat wave probability are largely explained by a rigid shift of the daily temperature distribution. In some locations where there is more warming, future heat wave probability is buffered somewhat by longer warm tails. In other parts of the Southwest where there is less warming, heat wave probability is relatively enhanced because of shorter tailed PDFs. Effects of PDF shape changes are generally small by comparison to those from a rigid shift, and fall within the range of uncertainty among models in the amount of warming expected by the end of the century.},

abstract = {Climate change may impact water resources management conditions in difficult-to-predict ways. A key challenge for water managers is how to incorporate highly uncertain information about potential climate change from global models into local- and regional-scale water management models and tools to support local planning. This paper presents a new method for developing large ensembles of local daily weather that reflect a wide range of plausible future climate change scenarios while preserving many statistical properties of local historical weather patterns. This method is demonstrated by evaluating the possible impact of climate change on the Inland Empire Utilities Agency service area in southern California. The analysis shows that climate change could impact the region, increasing outdoor water demand by up to 10{\%} by 2040, decreasing local water supply by up to 40{\%} by 2040, and decreasing sustainable groundwater yields by up to 15{\%} by 2040. The range of plausible climate projections suggests the need for the region to augment its long-range water management plans to reduce its vulnerability to climate change.

abstract = {Climate change will increase water stress in many regions placing greater pressures on rivers to meet human and ecological water needs. Managing rivers experiencing water stress requires a fundamental understanding of how ecosystem processes and functions respond to natural and anthropogenic drivers of flow variability and change. The field of environmental flows meets this need by defining "flow-ecology" relationships-mathematical models linking ecological characteristics and dynamics to the underlying flow regime. However, because these relationships are most often based on historical hydrologic regimes, they implicitly assume climatic stationarity. A fundamental challenge in the Anthropocene is how to model flow-ecology relationships such that the effects of nonstationarity can be captured. In the present article, we introduce a novel approach that addresses these shortcomings and show its utility through a series of conceptual and empirical examples. The framework incorporates ecological dynamics and uncertain future hydrologic conditions, as well as nonstationarity itself, thereby providing a viable framework for modeling flow-ecology responses to inform water management in a rapidly changing climate.},

abstract = {Regime shift modeling and management generally focus on tipping points, early warning indicators, and the prevention of abrupt shifts to undesirable states. Few studies assess the potential for restoring a deteriorating ecosystem that is on a transition pathway toward an undesirable state. During the transition, feedbacks that stabilize the new regime are still weak, providing an opportunity to reverse the ongoing shift. Here, we present a social-ecological model that explores both how transient social processes affect ecological dynamics in the vicinity of a tipping point to reinforce the desired state and how social mechanisms of policy implementation affect restoration time. We simulate transitions of a lake, policy making, and behavioral change by lake polluters to study the time lags that emerge as a response to the transient, deteriorating lake state. We found that restoration time is most sensitive to the timing of policy making, but that the transient dynamics of the social processes determined outcomes in nontrivial ways. Social pressure to adopt costly technology, in our case on-site sewage treatment, was up to a degree capable of compensating for delays in municipal policy making. Our analysis of interacting social and ecological time lags in the transient phase of a shallow lake highlights opportunities for restoration that a stable state analysis would miss. We discuss management perspectives for navigating critical feedbacks in a transitioning social-ecological system. The understanding of transient dynamics and the interaction with social time lags can be more relevant than solely stable states and tipping points.},

abstract = {Rapid growth and development in Carson Valley is causing concern over the continued availability of water resources to sustain such growth into the future. A study to address concerns over water resources and to update estimates of water-budget components in Carson Valley was begun in 2003 by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with Douglas County, Nevada. This report summarizes micrometeorologic, soil-chloride, and streambed-temperature data collected in Carson Valley from April 2003 through November 2004. Using these data, estimates of rates of discharge by evapotranspiration (ET), rates of recharge from precipitation in areas of native vegetation on the eastern and northern sides of the valley, and rates of recharge and discharge from streamflow infiltration and seepage on the valley floor were calculated. These rates can be used to develop updated water budgets for Carson Valley and to evaluate potential effects of land- and water-use changes on the valley's water budget. Data from eight ET stations provided estimates of annual ET during water year 2004, the sixth consecutive year of a drought with average or below average precipitation since 1999. Estimated annual ET from flood-irrigated alfalfa where the water table was from 3 to 6 feet below land surface was 3.1 feet. A similar amount of ET, 3.0 feet, was estimated from flood-irrigated alfalfa where the water table was about 40 feet below land surface. Estimated annual ET from flood-irrigated pasture ranged from 2.8 to 3.2 feet where the water table ranged from 2 to 5 feet below land surface, and was 4.4 feet where the water table was within 2 feet from land surface. Annual ET estimated from nonirrigated pasture was 1.7 feet. Annual ET estimated from native vegetation was 1.9 feet from stands of rabbitbrush and greasewood near the northern end of the valley, and 1.5 feet from stands of native bitterbrush and sagebrush covering alluvial fans along the western side of the valley. Uncertainty in most ET estimates is about 12 percent, but ranged from +30 and +50 percent to –20 and –40 percent for nonirrigated pasture and native bitterbrush and sagebrush. Estimated rates for water year 2004 likely are less than those during years of average, or above average precipitation when the water table would be closer to land surface. Test holes drilled in areas of native vegetation on the northern and eastern sides of Carson Valley had high concentrations of soil chloride at depths ranging from 4 to 18 feet below land surface at six locations on the eastern side of the valley. The high chloride concentrations indicate that modern-day precipitation at the six locations does not percolate deeper than the root zone of native vegetation. Estimates of the time required to accumulate the measured amount of chloride to depths of about 30 feet below land surface at the six test holes ranged from about 3,000 to 12,000 years. Low concentrations of soil chloride in two test holes on the northern end of Carson Valley and in a test hole on the eastern side of Fish Spring Flat indicate that a small amount of recharge from modern-day precipitation is taking place. Estimated annual recharge from precipitation at the two locations was 0.03 and 0.04 foot on the northern end of the valley and 0.02 foot on the eastern side of Fish Spring Flat. Uncertainty in the estimated recharge rates was about ±0.01 foot. Estimates of the time required to accumulate the measured amount of chloride to depths of about 30 feet below land surface at the three test holes ranged from about 100 to 700 years. The two test holes near the northern end of the valley are in gravel and eolian sand deposits and recharge from precipitation may be taking place at similar rates in other areas with gravel and eolian sand deposits. Based on results from other test holes, recharge at the rate estimated for the test hole on the eastern side of Fish Spring Flat is not likely applicable to a large area.},

abstract = {In Mediterranean and other water-stressed climates, water management is critical to the conservation of freshwater ecosystems. To secure and maintain water allocations for the environment, integrated water management approaches are needed that consider ecosystem flow requirements, patterns of human water demands and the temporal and spatial dynamics of water availability. 2. Human settlements in Mediterranean climates have constructed water storage and conveyance projects at a scale and level of complexity far exceeding those in other, less seasonal climates. As a result, multiple ecological stressors associated with natural periods of flooding and drying are compounded by anthropogenic impacts resulting from water infrastructure development. 3. Despite substantial investments in freshwater ecosystem conservation, particularly in California, U.S.A., success has been limited because the scales at which river management and restoration are implemented are often discordant with the temporal and spatial scales at which ecosystem processes operate. Often, there is also strong social and political resistance to restricting water allocation to existing consumptive uses for environmental protection purposes. Furthermore, institutions rarely have the capacity to develop and implement integrated management programmes needed for freshwater ecosystem conservation. 4. We propose an integrated framework for streamflow management that explicitly considers the temporal and spatial dynamics of water supply and needs of both human and natural systems. This approach makes it possible to assess the effects of alternative management strategies to human water security and ecosystem conditions and facilitates integrated decision-making by water management institutions. 5. We illustrate the framework by applying a GIS-based hydrologic model in a Mediterranean-climate watershed in Sonoma County, California, U.S.A. The model is designed to assess the hydrologic impacts of multiple water users distributed throughout a stream network. We analyse the effects of vineyard water management on environmental flows to (i) evaluate streamflow impacts from small storage ponds designed to meet human water demands and reduce summer diversions, (ii) prioritise the placement of storage ponds to meet human water needs while optimising environmental flow benefits and (iii) examine the environmental and social consequences of flow management policies designed to regulate the timing of diversions to protect ecosystem functions. 6. Thematic implications: spatially explicit models that represent anthropogenic stressors (e.g. water diversions) and environmental flow needs are required to address persistent and growing threats to freshwater biodiversity. A coupled human-natural system approach to water management is particularly useful in Mediterranean climates, characterised by severe competition for water resources and high spatial and temporal variability in flow regimes. However, lessons learned from our analyses are applicable to other highly seasonal systems and those that are expected to have increased precipitation variability resulting from climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

abstract = {To ensure that the environment is adequately protected and abstractors are fairly regulated, hydroecological assessment tools are needed that give local interpretation, indicate where ecological communities might not be resilient to current or future abstraction pressures, and take account of the effect of other stressors. These tools should ideally be transferrable across different river catchments. This study presents a hydroecological model indicating that macro-invertebrates were not resilient to long-term, steady-state levels of groundwater abstraction when flows at Q75 were reduced by more than 50{\%} in unpolluted streams in the West Midlands of England. The proportion of silt and clay covering the substratum and distance from source were also significant predictors of ecological condition, but did not interact with the abstraction effect. Combinations of different biotic indices and supplementary field observations of catchment land use gave additional evidence of the impacts of excessive inputs of fine sediment overriding the effects of abstraction at some locations. This study has shown that regional hydroecological models can be used with existing environmental flow indicators and other local environmental information as a weight of evidence to identify where abstraction and excessive inputs of fine sediment need to be mitigated separately or together to achieve the full ecological benefits. Such regional hydroecological models can increase the certainty of regulatory decisions made at the local scale for licencing abstraction at current use and predicted future levels.},

abstract = {We provide a critical review of indirect methods to elucidate water flows and contaminant transfer pathways through meso-scale catchments, as the proliferation of such methods in recent years has made it very difficult for potential users to evaluate their relative merits. We focus on agricultural contaminants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, faecal bacteria and sediment, as there is a substantial risk for them to contaminate waterways wherever agriculture exists. While direct measurements may be feasible at the plot/farm scale, their high resource demands make them prohibitive at the catchment scale. Water flows converging at the catchment outlet offer the opportunity to employ indirect methods to interpret hydrological and/or chemical data observed there as integrative signatures reflecting the various pathways through a catchment. We focus on meso-scale catchments (≈ 10–103 km2) as the surface water monitoring data required for indirect methods is typically available at this scale. We reviewed the literature to provide an overview of the numerous methods used (e.g., hydrograph separation, concentration-discharge analysis, pollutograph/loadograph analysis, end-member mixing analysis). Particular attention is given to the spatial scale the methods have been applied to, and their data needs (type of data, required temporal and spatial resolution). Advantages and disadvantages in terms of data availability and underlying assumptions are highlighted to facilitate the selection of a suitable method. While no single indirect method will provide all the answers, well-informed selection of one or more has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of water flows and contaminant transfers at the catchment scale.},

abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are impacted by climate change. However, the level of impacts, especially on macroinvertebrates, are not well known, which is the goal of this study. Here, three biotic indices were used. The Saginaw River Basin, the largest watershed in Michigan was selected for this study. Since no know modeling package exists to evaluate the impacts of climate change on these biotic indices, a coupled modeling approach was proposed. First, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was setup to estimate streamflow and water quality for all stream segments. Next, the results from the SWAT model in combination with long-term biological monitoring data were used to develop biotic indices predictive models using a two-phase approach. An assemblage of 42 climate scenarios (2040–2060) were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which are biased corrected and statistically downscaled. The dataset provides two extreme Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to account for best (RCP 4.5) and worst (RCP 8.5) case scenarios. The climate data were incorporated in SWAT and biotic indices predictive models to understand stream health conditions in the watershed. Results showed that the majority of streams have a probability of declining in values of biotic indices while streams that currently have excellent conditions are the most vulnerable streams to the climate change. This modeling approach provides a new mean to link more strongly biota indicators with flow regime indicators, which is of prime interest for the implementation of ecohydrology principles.},

abstract = {The environmental flow is a management tool to mitigate the impact of a dam on ecosystems. The Ecuadorian law requires that the environmental flow remains 10{\%} of mean annual flow in old hydroelectric stations, however advances on this area suggest this is not adequate. The objective of this research was to assess the impacts of a 10{\%} release and establish environmental flow recommendations in the Mach{\'{a}}ngara and Chulco rivers which have been dammed by the Chanlud and El Labrado hydroelectric plants, in the watershed of the Mach{\'{a}}ngara River (southern Ecuador). During twelve months physical and chemical parameters, and aquatic macro-invertebrates were recorded. The analysis found significant differences in some parameters, indicating a decline in ecosystem condition and relations were found between the flow, the diversity of macro-invertebrates and the concentration of dissolved O2 (DO). However, determining whether these impacts are unacceptable is difficult because Ecuador does not have established criteria for required ecological condition. This deterioration in ecological conditions can be minimized by applying more modern methods of environmental flow assessment such as the basic flow methodology (BFM) that allows the variability of the river flow. In the Mach{\'{a}}ngara River (3000–4000 m a.s.l.) an environmental flow of 27–51{\%} of the mean annual flow for the rainy season and 29–42{\%} in the dry season were determined by using BFM. Whereas for the Chulco River (3000–4000 m a.s.l.) the environmental flow was 15–45{\%} of the mean annual flow for the rainy season and 15–36{\%} for the dry season.},

abstract = {The Walla Walla Basin, in Eastern Oregon and Washington, USA, faces challenges in sustaining an agricultural water supply while maintaining sufficient flow in the Walla Walla River for endangered fish populations. Minimum summer river flow of 0.71 m3/s is required, forcing irrigators to substitute groundwater from a declining aquifer for lost surface water diversion. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) was initiated in 2004 attempting to restore groundwater levels and improve agricultural viability. The Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM) was used to compute surface and shallow groundwater conditions in the basin under water management scenarios with varying water use, MAR, and allowable minimum river flow. A mean increase of 1.5 m of groundwater elevation, or 1.5 {\%} of total aquifer storage, was predicted over the model area when comparing maximum MAR and no MAR scenarios where minimum river flow was increased from current level. When comparing these scenarios a 53 {\%} greater summer flow in springs was predicted with the use of MAR. Results indicate MAR can supplement irrigation supply while stabilizing groundwater levels and increasing summer streamflow. Potential increase in long-term groundwater storage is limited by the high transmissivity of the aquifer material. Increased MAR caused increased groundwater discharge through springs and stream beds, benefiting aquatic habitat rather than building long-term aquifer storage. Judicious siting of recharge basins may be a means of increasing the effectiveness of MAR in the basin.},

abstract = {Relating watershed structure to streamflow generation is a primary focus of hydrology. However, comparisons of longitudinal variability in stream discharge with adjacent valley structure have been rare, resulting in poor understanding of the distribution of the hydrologic mechanisms that cause variability in streamflow generation along valleys. This study explores detailed surveys of stream base flow across a gauged, 23 km 2 mountain watershed. Research objectives were (1) to relate spatial variability in base flow to fundamental elements of watershed structure, primarily topographic contributing area, and (2) to assess temporal changes in the spatial patterns of those relationships during a seasonal base flow recession. We analyzed spatiotemporal variability in base flow using (1) summer hydrographs at the study watershed outlet and 5 subwatershed outlets and (2) longitudinal series of discharge measurements every ∼100 m along the streams of the 3 largest subwatersheds (1200 to 2600 m in valley length), repeated 2 to 3 times during base flow recession. Reaches within valley segments of 300 to 1200 m in length tended to demonstrate similar streamflow generation characteristics. Locations of transitions between these segments were consistent throughout the recession, and tended to be collocated with abrupt longitudinal transitions in valley slope or hillslope-riparian characteristics. Both within and among subwatersheds, correlation between the spatial distributions of streamflow and topographic contributing area decreased during the recession, suggesting a general decrease in the influence of topography on stream base flow contributions. As topographic controls on base flow evidently decreased, multiple aspects of subsurface structure were likely to have gained influence. Copyright 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Climate-change adaptation planning for managed wetlands is challenging under uncertain futures when the impact of historic climate variability on wetland response is unquantified. We assessed vulnerability of Modoc National Wildlife Refuge (MNWR) through use of the Basin Characterization Model (BCM) landscape hydrology model, and six global climate models, representing projected wetter and drier conditions. We further developed a conceptual model that provides greater value for water managers by incorporating the BCM outputs into a conceptual framework that links modeled parameters to refuge management outcomes. This framework was used to identify landscape hydrology parameters that reflect refuge sensitivity to changes in (1) climatic water deficit (CWD) and recharge, and (2) the magnitude, timing, and frequency of water inputs. BCM outputs were developed for 1981–2100 to assess changes and forecast the probability of experiencing wet and dry water year types that have historically resulted in challenging conditions for refuge habitat management. We used a Yule's Q skill score to estimate the probability of modeled discharge that best represents historic water year types. CWD increased in all models across 72.3–100 {\%} of the water supply basin by 2100. Earlier timing in discharge, greater cool season discharge, and lesser irrigation season water supply were predicted by most models. Under the worst-case scenario, moderately dry years increased from 10–20 to 40–60 {\%} by 2100. MNWR could adapt by storing additional water during the cool season for later use and prioritizing irrigation of habitats during dry years.},

Rivers are challenging subjects for experimentation, because they are open systems that cannot be isolated from their social context. We identify principles to address the challenges of conducting effective large-scale flow experiments. Flow experiments have both scientific and social value when they help to resolve specific questions about the ecological action of flow with a clear nexus to water policies and decisions. Water managers must integrate new information into operating policies for large-scale experiments to be effective. Modeling and monitoring can be integrated with experiments to analyze long-term ecological responses. Experimental design should include spatially extensive observations and well-defined, repeated treatments. Large-scale flow manipulations are only a part of dam operations that affect river systems.

abstract = {Continental-domain assessments of climate change impacts on water resources typically rely on statistically downscaled climate model outputs to force hydrologic models at a finer spatial resolution. This study examines the effects of four statistical downscaling methods [bias-corrected constructed analog (BCCA), bias-corrected spatial disaggregation applied at daily (BCSDd) and monthly scales (BCSDm), and asynchronous regression (AR)] on retrospective hydrologic simulations using three hydrologic models with their default parameters (the Community Land Model, version 4.0; the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, version 4.1.2; and the Precipitation–Runoff Modeling System, version 3.0.4) over the contiguous United States (CONUS). Biases of hydrologic simulations forced by statistically downscaled climate data relative to the simulation with observation-based gridded data are presented. Each statistical downscaling method produces different meteorological portrayals including precipitation amount, wet-day frequency, and the energy input (i.e., shortwave radiation), and their interplay affects estimations of precipitation partitioning between evapotranspiration and runoff, extreme runoff, and hydrologic states (i.e., snow and soil moisture). The analyses show that BCCA underestimates annual precipitation by as much as −250 mm, leading to unreasonable hydrologic portrayals over the CONUS for all models. Although the other three statistical downscaling methods produce a comparable precipitation bias ranging from −10 to 8 mm across the CONUS, BCSDd severely overestimates the wet-day fraction by up to 0.25, leading to different precipitation partitioning compared to the simulations with other downscaled data. Overall, the choice of downscaling method contributes to less spread in runoff estimates (by a factor of 1.5–3) than the choice of hydrologic model with use of the default parameters if BCCA is excluded.},

abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are rarely purely ecological. Not only is the regime shift frequently triggered by human activity, but the responses of relevant actors to ecological dynamics are often crucial to the development and even existence of the regime shift. Here, we show that the dynamics of human behaviour in response to ecological changes can be crucial in determining the overall dynamics of the system. We find a social-ecological regime shift in a model of harvesters of a common-pool resource who avoid over-exploitation of the resource by social ostracism of non-complying harvesters. The regime shift, which can be triggered by several different drivers individually or also in combination, consists of a breakdown of the social norm, sudden collapse of co-operation and an over-exploitation of the resource. We use the approach of generalized modeling to study the robustness of the regime shift to uncertainty over the specific forms of model components such as the ostracism norm and the resource dynamics. Importantly, the regime shift in our model does not occur if the dynamics of harvester behaviour are not included in the model. Finally, we sketch some possible early warning signals for the social-ecological regime shifts we observe in the models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Groundwater aquifers provide an important “insurance” against climate variability. Due to prolonged droughts and/or irrigation demands, groundwater exploitation results in significant groundwater storage depletion. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a promising management practice that intentionally places or retains more water in groundwater aquifers than would otherwise naturally occur. In this study, we examine the possibility of using large irrigated agricultural areas as potential MAR locations (Ag-MAR). Using the California Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model we tested four different agricultural recharge land distributions, two streamflow diversion locations, eight recharge target amounts, and five recharge timings. These scenarios allowed a systematic evaluation of Ag-MAR on changes in regional, long-term groundwater storage, streamflow, and groundwater levels. The results show that overall availability of stream water for recharge is critical for Ag-MAR systems. If stream water availability is limited, longer recharge periods at lower diversion rates allow diverting larger volumes and more efficient recharge compared to shorter diversion periods with higher rates. The recharged stream water increases both groundwater storage and net groundwater contributions to streamflow. During the first decades of Ag-MAR operation, the diverted water contributed mainly to groundwater storage. After 80 years of Ag-MAR operation about 34{\%} of the overall diverted water remained in groundwater storage while 66{\%} discharged back to streams, enhancing base flow during months with no recharge diversions. Groundwater level rise is shown to vary with the spatial and temporal distribution of Ag-MAR. Overall, Ag-MAR is shown to provide long-term benefits for water availability, in groundwater and in streams.},

@article{Dixon2016a,
abstract = {(Visit webpage to access recorded presenation and poster pdf). Regional assessments of climate change impacts require climate projections at sufficiently high spatial resolution to allow one to translate the effects of global-scale changes to the local environment. This translation process typically involves the use of statistical or dynamical downscaling techniques to refine the results of coarser resolution global climate models (GCMs) to the finer scales of interest to impacts researchers and stakeholders. Here we address one assumption inherent to all statistical downscaling of multi-decadal climate change projections – namely, that key statistical downscaling relationships determined to exist between observations and GCM simulations of the recent past are applicable to future climate projections. Lacking observations of the future, we utilize a perfect-model experimental design. Using the output of high resolution global dynamical climate model simulations, we examine the ability of three different statistical downscaling methods to simulate current and future mean and extreme temperature and precipitation measures across the United States. The GCM used is the GFDL-HiRAM-C360 model, and the three downscaling techniques tested are the simple delta, monthly quantile mapping, and daily asynchronous quantile regression methods. The experimental design differs from the usual real-world application of statistical downscaling in that no observations are used. Instead, the study uses output from a set of high resolution GCM experiments – some of which were run to simulate the climate of recent decades and others that simulate conditions at the end of the 21st century under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Companion data sets were constructed by interpolating the high resolution ({\~{}}25km) GCM output to a much coarser grid ({\~{}}200km). During the downscaling training step, statistical methods quantify relationships between the high resolution and coarse resolution data sets for the historical period. Then, using the coarsened data sets as input, we assess how well the downscaling relationships deduced from the historical period can reconstruct the high resolution GCM output, both for the historical period and for the late 21st century projections. This perfect model framework allows one to test the assumption of statistical stationarity by determining the extent to which a downscaling method's skill is degraded for future projections relative to the historical period. Results will be presented showing how the validity of assuming stationarity varies regionally, seasonally, and by variable of interest. We also discuss how this methodology can be extended, including (a) exploring additional geographic regions and variables of interest, (b) using different GCMs and statistical downscaling methods, and (c) by generating more challenging tests by altering the distribution of the coarsened data sets rather than merely interpolating from the high resolution grid.},

abstract = {Widespread hydrologic alteration creates a need for tools to assess ecological impacts to streams that can be applied across large geographic scales. A regional framework for biologically based flow management can help catchment managers prioritise streams for protection, evaluate impacts of disturbance or interventions and provide a starting point for causal assessment in degraded streams. However, lack of flow data limit the ability to assess hydrologic conditions across a region. Hydrologic models can address this problem. Regionally calibrated hydrologic models were used to estimate current and reference flows at 572 bioassessment sites in southern and central coastal California. Flow alteration was characterised as the difference in 39 flow metrics calculated from simulations of present-day and reference flow time-series, calculated under up to four precipitation conditions. Biological condition was assessed with the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) and its components. Logistic regressions were used to predict the likelihood of high scores (i.e. ≥10th percentile of the CSCI reference calibration data). Statistically significant relationships between increasing severity of hydrologic alteration and decreasing biological condition were used to set thresholds that reflected tolerance for risk of a stakeholder advisory group. An index of hydrologic alteration was created by selecting flow metrics based on their importance for predicting biological response variables in boosted regression tree models. Metrics were selected in the order of decreasing importance, and no more than two metrics per metric class were selected (i.e. duration, frequency, magnitude, timing and variability). Seven metrics were selected: HighDur (duration of high-flow events), HighNum ({\#} of high-flow events), NoDisturb (duration between high- or low-flow events), MaxMonthQ (maximum monthly discharge), Q99 (99th percentile of daily streamflow), QmaxIDR (interdecile range of annual maxima) and RBI (Richards–Baker Index). Applying the index to data from a probabilistic survey, 34{\%} of stream-miles in southern California were estimated to be hydrologically altered. One of four management priorities were assigned to each site based on biological condition and hydrologic status: protection (healthy and unaltered, 52{\%} of stream-miles), monitoring (healthy but altered 4{\%}), evaluation of flow management (unhealthy and altered, 30{\%}) and evaluation of other management (unhealthy but unaltered, 14{\%}). Regionally derived biologically based targets for flow alteration allow catchment managers to prioritise activities and conduct screenings for causal assessments across large spatial scales. Furthermore, regional tools pave the way for incorporation of hydrologic management in policies and catchment planning designed to support biological integrity in streams. Development of regional tools should be a priority where hydrologic alteration is pervasive or expected to increase in response to climate change or urbanisation.},

abstract = {Sixty streams in lower Michigan were surveyed for natural reproduction of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytshcha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in 1976-1979. Most chinook reproduction was found in the larger trout streams. Coho salmon also reproduced in the larger trout waters but utilized more of the small tributary streams than did chinook salmon. A postive correlation was found between stream velocity and the amount of chinook salmon reproduction, with no reproduction found in stream areas where the water velocity was below 0.3 m/sec. The increased abundance of chinook salmon fry with increasing velocity may reflect better conditions for reproduction as gravels become coarser. An estimated 630,000 chinook salmon smolts were produced in Michigan's Lower Peninsula tributaries of Lake Michigan in 1979. This was 23{\%} of the chinook smolt production in 1979 from Michigan waters (including hatchery plants). Where substantial reproduction or potential for reproduction is found in Great Lakes tributaries, savings in hatchery costs can be made by decreasing stocking on a gradual basis, or by reducing angling pressure to increase egg deposition.},

Eventually, perhaps, a great deal: the overall climate response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may prove much simpler and more predictable than the chaos of short- term weather. Quantifying the diversity of possible responses is essential for any objective, probability-based climate forecast, and this task will require a new generation of climate modelling experiments, systematically exploring the range of model behaviour that is consistent with observations. It will be substantially harder to quantify the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle than in global-mean temperature, both because the observations are less complete and because the physical constraints are weaker.},

abstract = {Human impacts prior to the Industrial Revolution are not well constrained. We investigate whether the decline in global atmospheric CO 2 concentration by 7–10 ppm in the late 1500s and early 1600s which globally lowered surface air temperatures by 0.15 ∘ C, were generated by natural forcing or were a result of the large-scale depopulation of the Americas after European arrival, subsequent land use change and secondary succession. We quantitatively review the evidence for (i) the pre-Columbian population size, (ii) their per capita land use, (iii) the post-1492 population loss, (iv) the resulting carbon uptake of the abandoned anthropogenic landscapes, and then compare these to potential natural drivers of global carbon declines of 7–10 ppm. From 119 published regional population estimates we calculate a pre-1492 CE population of 60.5 million (interquartile range, IQR 44.8–78.2 million), utilizing 1.04 ha land per capita (IQR 0.98–1.11). European epidemics removed 90{\%} (IQR 87–92{\%}) of the indigenous population over the next century. This resulted in secondary succession of 55.8 Mha (IQR 39.0–78.4 Mha) of abandoned land, sequestering 7.4 Pg C (IQR 4.9–10.8 Pg C), equivalent to a decline in atmospheric CO 2 of 3.5 ppm (IQR 2.3–5.1 ppm CO 2 ). Accounting for carbon cycle feedbacks plus LUC outside the Americas gives a total 5 ppm CO 2 additional uptake into the land surface in the 1500s compared to the 1400s, 47–67{\%} of the atmospheric CO 2 decline. Furthermore, we show that the global carbon budget of the 1500s cannot be balanced until large-scale vegetation regeneration in the Americas is included. The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth System in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution.},

We illustrate this framework with a case study, whereby fish community responses to various water-management scenarios were predicted in a partially regulated river system at a local watershed scale. This case study simulates management scenarios based on interactive effects of dam operation protocols, withdrawals for municipal water supply, effluent discharges from wastewater treatment, and inter-basin water transfers. Modeled streamflow was integrated with flow-ecology relationships relating hydrologic departure from reference conditions to fish species richness, stratified by trophic, reproductive, and habitat characteristics. Adding a hypothetical new water-withdrawal site was predicted to increase the frequency of low-flow conditions with adverse effects for several fish groups. Imposition of new reservoir release requirements was predicted to enhance flow and fish species richness immediately downstream of the reservoir, but these effects were dissipated further downstream. The framework presented here can be used to translate flow-ecology relationships into evidence-based management by developing decision-support systems for conservation of riverine biodiversity while optimizing water availability for human use.},

These relationships can be specific for different natural flow regime types. The object of our study is testing the ELOHA method in the Ebro River Basin. Seven flow alteration–ecological response curves were obtained in the present study as preliminary guidelines for developing and calibrating environmental flow standards in the Ebro River Basin. For continental Mediterranean-pluvial flow regime mean monthly flow in March was related to Plecoptera abundance (ELOHAs ±21{\%} from baseline), and high flow magnitude and frequency were closely related to Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera richness (ELOHAs for high flow magnitude and frequency were +18 and +54{\%} the reference central value respectively). For nivo-pluvial flow regime, high flow magnitude was found indicative of macroinvertebrate biodiversity and Coleoptera abundance (ELOHAS −12 and +23{\%} from central reference value respectively). And for pluvio-oceanic flow regime, mean monthly flow in January was indicative of the proportion of Gastropoda, Oligochaeta and Diptera taxa (GOLD index) (ELOHA +17{\%} from baseline). These hydrological limits are endorsed by recent international reference works. Flow alteration–ecological relationships presented here were constructed from real monthly flow data records and macroinvertebrate samples at family level.

abstract = {Depending on population, wild Fraser River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka travel distances of {\textless}100 km to {\textgreater}1100 km and ascend elevations ranging from near sea-level to 1200 m to reach spawning areas. Populations embarking on distant, high elevation migrations (i.e. Early Stuart, Chilko and Horsefly populations) began their upriver spawning migrations with higher densities of somatic energy (c. 9.2 to 9.8 MJ kg-1) and fewer eggs (c. 3200 to 3800) than populations making shorter, low elevation migrations (i.e. Weaver and Adams; c. 7.1 to 8.3 MJ kg-1 gross somatic energy and c. 4300 to 4700 eggs). Populations making difficult upriver migrations also had morphologies that were smaller and more fusiform than populations making less difficult migrations, traits that may facilitate somatic energy conservation by reducing transport costs. Indeed, fish travelling long distances expended less somatic energy per unit of migratory difficulty than those travelling shorter distances (2.8 to 3.8 kJ v. 10-1400 kJ). Consistent with evolutionary theory, difficult migrations appear to select for energy efficiency but ultimately fish making more difficult migrations produce fewer eggs, even when differences in body length have been accounted for. Despite large among-population differences in somatic energy at the start of upriver migration, all populations completed migration and spawning, and subsequently died, with c. 4 MJ kg-1 of energy remaining, a level which may reflect a threshold to sustain life. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {Non-perennial rivers and streams are ubiquitous on our planet. Although several metrics have been used to statistically group or compare streamflow characteristics, there is currently no widely used definition of how many days or over what reach length surface flow must cease in order to classify a river as non-perennial. At the same time, the breadth of climate and geographic settings for non-perennial rivers leads to diversity in their flow regimes, such as how often or how quickly they go dry. These rivers have a rich and expanding body of literature addressing their ecologic and geomorphic features, but are often said to be ignored by hydrologists. Yet there is much we do know about their hydrology in terms of streamflow generation processes, water losses, and variability in flow. We also know that while they are prevalent in arid regions, they occur across all climate types and experience a diverse set of natural and anthropogenic controls on streamflow. Furthermore, measuring and modeling the hydrology of these rivers presents a distinct set of challenges, and there are many research directions, which still require further attention. Therefore, we present an overview of the current understanding, methodologic challenges, knowledge gaps, and research directions for hydrologic understanding of non-perennial rivers; critical topics in light of both growing global water scarcity and ever-changing laws and policies that dictate whether and how much environmental protection these rivers receive.

abstract = {Large state or regional environmental flow programs, such as the one based on the California Environmental Flows Framework, rely on broadly applicable relationships between flow and ecology to inform management decisions. California, despite having high flow and bioassessment data density, has not established relationships between specific elements of the annual hydrograph and biological stream condition. To address this, we spatially and temporally linked USGS gage stations and biological assessment sites in California to identify suitable paired sites for comparisons of streamflow alteration with biological condition at a statewide scale. Flows were assessed using a set of functional flow metrics that provide a comprehensive way to compare alteration and seasonal variation in streamflow across different locations. Biological response was evaluated using the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) and Algal Stream Condition Index (ASCI), which quantify biological conditions by translating benthic invertebrate or algal resources and watershed-scale environmental data into an overall measure of stream health. These indices provide a consistent statewide standard for interpreting bioassessment data, and thus, a means of quantitatively comparing stream conditions throughout the state. The results indicate that indices of biological stream condition were most closely associated with flow alteration in seasonality and timing metrics, such as fall pulse timing, dry-season timing, and wet season timing. Magnitude metrics such as dry-season baseflow, wet season baseflow, and the fall pulse magnitude were also important in influencing biological stream conditions. Development of ecological flow needs in large-scale environmental programs should consider that alteration to any of the seasonal flow components (e.g., dry-season baseflow, fall pulse flow, wet-season baseflow, spring recession flow) may be important in restructuring biological communities.},

Using as input the output from large-scale dynamical climate models and observation-based data products, SD aims to provide a finer grain of detail and to mitigate systematic biases. It is generally recognized as providing added value. However, one of the key assumptions of SD is that the relationships used to train the method during a historical period are unchanged in the future, in the face of climate change. The validity of this assumption is typically quite difficult to assess in the normal course of analysis, as observations of future climate are lacking. We approach this problem using a “perfect model” experimental design in which high-resolution dynamical climate model output is used as a surrogate for both past and future observations.We find that while SD in general adds considerable value, in certain well-defined circumstances it can produce highly erroneous results.

abstract = {Two foundational questions about sustainability are “How are ecosystems and the services they provide going to change in the future?” and “How do human decisions affect these trajectories?” Answering these questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes. Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.},

A fully distributed eco-hydrological model combines a hydrology component based on the modified MODFLOW, with a vegetation dynamic component described by Verhulst logistic equation. The validation of the eco-hydrological model using groundwater well observation, river stage observation and remote sensing data demonstrated that the good capability of the model in simulating the dynamic of the eco-hydrological system in lower reach of Tarim River. The interaction between the hydrological component and ecological component has been revealed through water balance analysis and scenario studies. Vegetation has a significant impact on groundwater evapotranspiration, groundwater storage change and groundwater depth, while groundwater depth is a critical feedback variable that determines the vegetation dynamics, which is shown by observation and simulation result. The eco-hydrological model represented in this study could help to groundwater dependent ecosystem restoration and protection, particularly for riparian ecosystem.},

We then use the pdfs to estimate midcentury climate-related risks to a water utility in one of the regions. We show that the variance of climate changes is underestimated across all regions if model correlations are ignored, and in some cases, the mean change shifts as well.

abstract = {During a period of 4 years, 1974–77, in Uppsala county; Sweden, 203 women underwent surgery for ectopic pregnancy with histological proof of the diagnosis. For the female population of fertile age this corresponds to 0.11 ectopics per 100 women 15–44 years of age, or 1.08 per 100 notified pregnancies, or 1.53 per 100 births. Fifty‐five of the women with ectopic pregnancy were using an intrauterine device (IUD) (48 a copper‐bearing IUD and 7 some other type of device), and 6 women used a low dose progestogen contraceptive. For users of copper‐bearing IUDs the risk of an ectopic pregnancy was estimated to be 0.15 per 100 women years. When comparing this latter risk rate with the overall incidence rate of 0.11, it must be observed that the populations forming the denominator in these two rates differ with respect to some crucial characteristics. Nulliparity and predisposing factors were found statistically significantly more often in non‐IUD‐users with an ectopic pregnancy than in IUD‐users. Such predisposing factors may be less prevalent in IUD‐users, as in other populations. This may explain why ectopic pregnancy has been found to occur less frequently than theoretically expected among IUD‐users. The “ectopic preventing” capacity of the IUD may therefore be considerably lower than has been previously claimed. 1980 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand},

abstract = {Hydrologic model input datasets such as climate, land use, elevation, soil, and geology information are available in a range of scales for use in water resources investigations. Smaller spatial and temporal scale input data allow groundwater recharge models to simulate more physically realistic processes and presumably result in more accurate estimates of groundwater recharge. Projected climate data are, therefore, often downscaled to smaller spatial and temporal scales for use in these models. It is unknown, however, if increasingly smaller-scale climate data produce substantially different simulated recharge results, either in magnitude or trend. Also, even if simulated recharge results are different at a higher space and time resolution, simulation at coarser resolution might be adequate to provide recharge information at decision scales (e.g., meeting Colorado River compact requirements on a ten-year moving average basis). Historical climate datasets at three spatial (∼800 m, ∼4 km, and ∼12 km) and two temporal (daily and monthly) scales were used in a Soil Water Balance (SWB) model of the upper Colorado River basin (UCRB) to simulate groundwater recharge over the water-year 1982–2014 time period. The magnitude of annual and moving ten-year annual average recharge results for daily climate data were within 5{\%} and 7{\%} of ∼4 km results for ∼800 m and ∼12 km climate data, respectively, with deviations from 1982 to 2014 means within 1{\%} and 3{\%} (median), respectively. Comparison of simulated recharge results using the coarsest spatial and temporal climate data with results from the finest scale data indicated similar small differences over ten-year moving annual averages, over water years, and during high recharge months. While differences in simulated groundwater recharge magnitude, which may be important for groundwater-flow simulations, were substantial during some seasonal comparisons, trends in recharge were almost identical across scales, leading to similar conclusions about change from “normal”. Considering the uncertainty inherent in projected climate data, coarser spatial and longer temporal scale input data may be sufficient for water resources managers who need to understand changes in trends in groundwater recharge over water-year or longer time periods.},

abstract = {Although many researchers have reported yield increases due to alfalfa irrigation when soil water has been limited, little information is available on alfalfa plant and soil water relationships which might be used to improve water management strategies. Our objective was to determine effects of plant water deficits on alfalfa seasonal growth patterns, forage quality, forage yield, water use, and water-use effi-ciency. During 1981, established alfalfa grown on a sandy soll was subjected to four water supply levels designated: high irrigation (H), medium high irrigation (MH), medium low irrigation (ML), and unir-rigated, rainfall only (U). Soil water depletions occurred for all treat-ments to at least 1.9 m. Alfalfa midday plant water potentials in H and MH treatments ranged from -0.7 to -1.3 MPa throughout the season. For alfalfa subjected to ML and U treatments, {\~{}}mp reached --2.7 and --4.0 MPa, respectively. Dry weight (DW) accumulations for alfalfa in H and MH treatments increased with successive harvests during the summer while harvest DW for alfalfa in ML and U treat-ments declined. Relative growth rate (RGR) declined sharply as {\~{}}mp decreased. At moderate plant water stress ({\~{}}'mp of --1.5 to --2.0 MPa), little growth occurred and under severe water stress, ({\~{}}mp {\textless} -2.5 MPa), RGR were negative due to leaf loss. Reduced soil water avail-ability resulted in increased leaf:stem weight ratios and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD), but only under severe and long-term plant water stress. Crude protein (CP) concentration was unaffected by plant water status. It appeared that irrigation water could be used efficiently on coarse-textured soils by moderate water application to alfalfa at 50{\%} depletion of extractable soil water, an apparent thresh-old for maintenance of favorable plant water status. A close associ-ation between forage yield of individual harvests and cumulative indicates potential for initiation of irrigations when plant measure-ments indicate soll water depletions to a threshold level.},

abstract = {Flow regimes profoundly influence river organisms and ecosystem functions, but regulatory approaches often lack the scientific basis to support sustainable water allocation. In part, this reflects the challenge of understanding the ecological effects of flow variability over different temporal and spatial domains. Here, we use a process-based distributed hydrological model to simulate 23 years of natural flow regime in 100 bioassessment sites across the Adige River network (NE Italy), and to identify typical nivo-glacial, nivo-pluvial, and pluvial reaches. We then applied spatial stream-network models (SSN) to investigate the relationships between hydrologic and macroinvertebrate metrics while accounting for network spatial autocorrelation and local habitat conditions. Macroinvertebrate metrics correlated most strongly with summer, winter, and temporal variation in streamflow, but effects varied across flow regime types. For example (i) taxon richness appeared limited by high summer flows and high winter flows in nivo-glacial and pluvial streams, respectively; (ii) invertebrate grazers increased proportionally with the annual coefficient of flow variation in nivo-glacial streams but tended to decline with flow variation in pluvial streams. Although local land-use and water quality also affected benthic communities, most variation in macroinvertebrate metrics was associated with spatial autocorrelation. These findings highlight the importance of developing environmental flow management policies in ways that reflect specific hydro-ecological and land use contexts. Our analyses also illustrate the importance of spatially-explicit approaches that account for auto-correlation when quantifying flow-ecology relationships.},

abstract = {The covariation of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and temperature in Antarctic ice-core records suggests a close link betweenCO2 and climate during the Pleistocene ice ages. The role and relative importance ofCO2 in producing these climate changes remains unclear, however, in part because the ice-core deuterium record reflects local rather than global temperature. Here we construct a record of global surface temperature from 80 proxy records and show that temperature is correlated with and generally lags CO2 during the last (that is, the most recent) deglaciation. Differences between the respective temperature changes of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere parallel variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation recorded in marine sediments. These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2 concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age.},

abstract = {Restoration activities in the Central Valley of California and elsewhere require accurate evapotranspiration information, which can then be used for a wide variety of surface and subsurface hydrologic evaluations. However, directly measuring evapotranspiration can be difficult or impossible depending on the evaluation's time frame. Transferability of measured evapotranspiration in time and space is also necessary but typically requires a weather-based reference. For nonagricultural vegetation, there is at present time no standard reference, which makes the evaluation of a variety of vegetation types from different sources difficult and time-consuming. This paper examines several methods used to estimate evapotranspiration from native vegetation, including the use of vegetation coefficients (Kv). Vegetation coefficients are based on a standardized reference and are computed as the ratio of vegetation evapotranspiration (ETv) to the grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo). These monthly Kv values are used to compute the long-term (for this study, 1922-2009) average ETv for vegetation types documented to exist in California's Central Valley prior to the arrival of the first European settlers in the mid-18th century. For vegetation that relies on precipitation and soil moisture storage, a calibrated daily soil-water balance with a dual crop coefficient approach was used to compute evapotranspiration regionally over the time frame.},

abstract = {Intermittent rivers comprise a significant proportion of river networks globally and their spatial extent is predicted to increase with rising water abstraction pressures. Despite this, the ecological implications of hydrological modifications within intermittent rivers have received limited research attention. This paper examines macroinvertebrate assemblages across intermittent and perennial sections of headwater streams within the Hampshire Avon catchment (United Kingdom) over a five-year period. The composition of faunal assemblages was quantified in relation to four hydrological metrics: the duration of flowing conditions, the geographical proximity to the nearest perennial source along each watercourse (two observed flow parameters) and two modelled groundwater abstraction influences. The results highlight that macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting sites which dry periodically and are positioned at greater distances ({\textgreater} c. 2.5 km) above the perennial source (the most upstream point of permanent flow within a given year) possessed the highest conservation values. These sites supported species that are rare in many areas of Europe (e.g. Ephemeroptera: Paraletophlebia werneri) or with limited geographical distribution across the United Kingdom (e.g. Trichoptera: Limnephilus bipunctatus). A range of faunal community diversity indices were found to be more sensitive to the antecedent flow duration and distance from the perennial source, rather than any effects of groundwater abstraction. Taxonomic richness responded most strongly to these observed flow parameters and varied more markedly with the distance from the perennial source compared to the antecedent flow duration. Several taxa were significantly associated with the observed flow parameters, particularly those predominantly inhabiting perennially flowing systems. However, the distance that such fauna could migrate into intermittent reaches varied between taxa. This research demonstrates the overriding importance of antecedent flow durations and the geographical proximity to perennial sources on macroinvertebrate communities within intermittent and perennial headwater streams.},

abstract = {Over the last 20 years, climate models have been developed to an impressive level of complexity. They are core tools in the study of the interactions of many climatic processes and justifiably provide an additional strand in the argument that anthropogenic climate change is a critical global problem. Over a similar period, there has been growing interest in the interpretation and probabilistic analysis of the output of computer models; particularly, models of natural systems. The results of these areas of research are being sought and utilized in the development of policy, in other academic disciplines, and more generally in societal decision making. Here, our focus is solely on complex climate models as predictive tools on decadal and longer time scales. We argue for a reassessment of the role of such models when used for this purpose and a reconsideration of strategies for model development and experimental design. Building on more generic work, we categorize sources of uncertainty as they relate to this specific problem and discuss experimental strategies available for their quantification. Complex climate models, as predictive tools for many variables and scales, cannot be meaningfully calibrated because they are simulating a never before experienced state of the system; the problem is one of extrapolation. It is therefore inappropriate to apply any of the currently available generic techniques which utilize observations to calibrate or weight models to produce forecast probabilities for the real world. To do so is misleading to the users of climate science in wider society. In this context, we discuss where we derive confidence in climate forecasts and present some concepts to aid discussion and communicate the state-of-the-art. Effective communication of the underlying assumptions and sources of forecast uncertainty is critical in the interaction between climate science, the impacts communities and society in general. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The term "environmental flows" describes the quantities, quality, and patterns of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. Environmental flows may be achieved in a number of different ways, most of which are based on either (1) limiting alterations from the natural flow baseline to maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity or (2) designing flow regimes to achieve specific ecological and ecosystem service outcomes. We argue that the former practice is more applicable to natural and semi-natural rivers where the primary objective and opportunity is ecological conservation. The latter "designer" approach is better suited to modified and managed rivers where return to natural conditions is no longer feasible and the objective is to maximize natural capital as well as support economic growth, recreation, or cultural history. This permits elements of ecosystem design and adaptation to environmental change. In a future characterized by altered climates and intensive regulation, where hybrid and novel aquatic ecosystems predominate, the designer approach may be the only feasible option. This conclusion stems from a lack of natural ecosystems from which to draw analogs and the need to support broader socioeconomic benefits and valuable configurations of natural and social capital.},

But to date, there has been little grouping of these process facts. Here, we discuss how the “fill-and-spill” concept can provide a framework to group event-based runoff generation processes. The fill-and-spill concept describes where vertical and lateral additions of water to a landscape unit are placed into storage (the fill)—and only when this storage reaches a critical level (the spill), and other storages are filled and become connected, does a previously infeasible (but subsequently important) outflow pathway become activated. We show that fill-and-spill can be observed at a range of scales and propose that future fieldwork should first define the scale of interest and then evaluate what is filling-and-spilling at that scale. Such an approach may be helpful for those instrumenting and modeling new hillslopes or catchments because it provides a structured way to develop perceptual models for runoff generation and to group behaviors at different sites and scales.},

abstract = {Recent studies have documented the important role that ‘‘atmospheric rivers'' (ARs) of concentrated near-surface water vapor above the Pacific Ocean play in the storms and floods in California, Oregon, and Washington. By delivering large masses of warm, moist air (sometimes directly from the Tropics), ARs establish conditions for the kinds of high snowlines and copious orographic rainfall that have caused the largest historical storms. In many California rivers, essentially all major historical floods have been associated with AR storms. As an example of the kinds of storm changes that may influence future flood frequencies, the occurrence of such storms in historical observations and in a 7-model ensemble of historical-climate and projected future climate simulations is evaluated. Under an A2 greenhouse-gas emissions scenario (with emissions accelerating throughout the 21st Century), average AR statistics do not change much in most climate models; however, extremes change notably. Years with many AR episodes increase, ARs with higher-than-historical water-vapor transport rates increase, and AR storm-temperatures increase. Furthermore, the peak season within which most ARs occur is commonly projected to lengthen, extending the flood-hazard season. All of these tendencies could increase opportunities for both more frequent and more severe floods in California under projected climate changes.},

abstract = {This paper explores the independent and combined effects of changes in temperature and runoff volume on California's water supply and potential water management adaptations. Least-cost water supply system adaptation is explored for two climate scenarios: 1) warmer-drier conditions, and 2) warmer conditions without change in total runoff, using the CALVIN economic-engineering optimization model of California's intertied water supply system for 2050 water demands. The warm-dry hydrology was developed from downscaled effects of the GFDL CM2. 1 (A2 emissions scenario) global climate model for a 30-year period centered at 2085. The warm-only scenario was developed from the warm-dry hydrology, preserving its seasonal runoff shift while maintaining mean annual flows from the historical hydrology. This separates the runoff volume and temperature effects of climate change on water availability and management adaptations. A warmer climate alone reduces water deliveries and increases costs, but much less than a warmer-drier climate, if the water supply system is well managed. Climate changes result in major changes in reservoir operations, cyclic storage of groundwater, and hydropower operations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Hydrologic alteration is a predominant stressor for biological resources in streams. This stress is further aggravated by competing human and ecological demands for limited water resources. Understanding flow–ecology relationships and establishing relevant and implementable flow targets are essential to protect biological communities. Estimating degree of ecologically relevant hydrologic alteration depends on the availability of long-term flow data at sites with biological information. However, measured flow data are seldom available at sufficient density to support large-scale analyses of the biological effects of hydrologic alterations. The ability to accurately simulate flows and estimate flow metrics at many ungauged locations across a broad geographical area remains a fundamental challenge. We address this challenge by applying a novel technique to simulate flow regimes at any stream reach of interest by first developing an ensemble of regionally calibrated and validated hydrological models, and then using a selection tool to match the “best-fit” model to ungauged stream reaches. An ensemble of 26 HEC-HMS rainfall–runoff models were calibrated to represent the range of catchment conditions in the southern California region. We developed current and historical flow regimes and a suite of flow metrics at 572 ungauged sites in southern California with bioassessment monitoring data. The flow metrics represent hydrograph characteristics of magnitude, timing, frequency, duration and variability. The flow metrics were estimated under three precipitation conditions—dry, wet and average. In addition, we estimated aggregated flow metrics for (dry + wet + average) condition. Hydrologic alteration was estimated as the deviation between the modelled current and historical flow metrics. Approximately 79{\%} of the region shows some degree of hydrologic alteration, and approximately 40{\%} of the sites are estimated to be severely altered. Magnitude metrics tend to increase in response to urban and agricultural land uses, whereas the timing and duration metrics are mostly unchanged. This mechanistic modelling approach demonstrates the feasibility of estimating flow alterations for ungauged catchments with relative ease of transferability over a broad geographical region. The continuous granular flow data allow for computation and consideration of metrics that may be applicable to a variety of ecological endpoints and consideration of a range of management trade-offs.},

abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

abstract = {High summer water temperatures can adversely affect stream salmonids in numerous ways. The direct effects of temperature associated with increased metabolic demand can be exacerbated by other factors, including decreased resistance to disease and increased susceptibility to parasites. We quantified the occurrence of black spot infestation caused by a neascus-type trematode (family Diplostomidae) of juvenile salmonids in Oregon's West Fork Smith River stream network during summer 2002 through fall 2003. The highest 7-d average of the daily maximum (ADM) temperatures was positively correlated with infestation rates in both years. We summarized the frequency and infestation severity of juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynclus kisutch by location within the network and summarized temperatures for 19 study reaches. Summer ADMs ranged from approximately 24 degrees C near the watershed mouth to approximately 17 degrees C in the upper reaches, while tributary ADMs ranged from approximately 16-18 degrees C in the lower reaches to 12-17 degrees C in the upper reaches. Temperatures were consistently higher in summer 2003 than in summer 2002. The presence of black spot infestation was more frequently noted in warm main-stem reaches than in adjacent cooler tributary reaches, and infestation rates were generally higher in 2003 than in 2002 in the same reach. Movements of coho salmon juveniles within the stream network also appeared to influence observed infestation rates.},

Results show that the spectral characteristics of the PDI vary from site to site throughout the U.S., while those of the SPI do not vary from site to site. They also show that the PDI has a complex structure with an exceptionally long memory, while the SPI is an easily inter- preted, simple moving average process.

abstract = {This paper describes the 'recruitment box,' an integrative model that defines the stream stage patterns that enable successful establishment of riparian cottonwood seedlings. In western North America, cottonwood seed dispersal generally occurs after annual peak river flows. The receding stream exposes moist sites upon which seeds land after transport by wind and water. Germination is rapid, and initial seedling establishment is often prolific. However, the vast majority of seedlings die, primarily due to drought stress, as root growth is insufficient to maintain contact with the receding zone of moisture. Cottonwood roots grow about 0.5 to 1 cm per day or 60 to 100 cm in the first year. Along the 'losing' streams in semi-arid regions, the riparian water table is an almost horizontal extension from the stream stage. A capillary fringe exists above the water table and is often 30 to 40 cm in elevation, but can range from about 5 to 130 cm depending on substrate texture. The combination of root growth and capillary fringe define the successful recruitment band, which is usually from about 0.6 to 2 m in elevation above the late summer stream stage. Within this range, higher elevation establishment occurs (i) for the Aigeiros cottonwoods, Populus deltoides, and P. fremontii, which grow more rapidly than Tacamahaca species and occur in warmer areas with longer growing seasons; (ii) along larger rivers that are characterized by more gradual stage fluctuations; and (iii) along streams with finer substrate. The rate of stream stage decline is also critical for seedling survival and should not exceed 2.5 cm per day. The recruitment box model is consistent with dendrochronological interpretations that moderate flood events are naturally required for cottonwood recruitment. Flood events with recurrences of about 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 years often satisfy the model and provide stream stage patterns with a gradual decline through the recruitment box. The model will facilitate analyses of the reproductive ecology of riparian cottonwoods and also permit the prescription of stream stage patterns for cottonwood seedling recruitment along dammed rivers.},

abstract = {Appraisal of hatchery-related effects on Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) is a necessary component of species conservation. For example, hatchery supplementation can influence species viability by changing genetic, phenotypic and life-history diversity. We analyzed time series data for seven salmonid taxa from the Klamath River basin, California, to investigate trajectories of wild and hatchery adult populations. Linear regression coupled with randomized permutations (n = 99,999), two- tailed t tests, and Bayesian change point analysis were used to detect trends over time. Cross correlation was also used to evaluate relationships between wild and hatchery populations. The taxa of interest were spring, fall, and late-fall Chinook Salmon (O. tshawytscha); Coho Salmon (O. kisutch); Coastal Cutthroat Trout (O. clarki clarki); and summer and hybrid Steelhead Trout (O. mykiss). Significant decreases were detected for summer and hybrid Steelhead Trout. The proportion of wild fall Chinook has also significantly decreased concurrently with increases in hatchery returns. In comparison, returns of most Chinook and coho runs to the hatcheries, and fall Chinook strays to wild spawning areas from Iron Gate Hatchery have significantly increased since the 1970s. Increases were also detected for wild late-fall Chinook and spring Chinook adults. However, both of these were significantly correlated with Chinook Salmon returns to Trinity River Hatchery, suggesting augmentation by hatchery strays. Changes in abundances appeared related to changing ocean habitat conditions and hatchery practices. Our results suggest that anadromous salmonid populations in the Klamath River basin are becoming increasingly dependent on hatchery propagation, a pattern that can threaten population persistence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review is to provide a global perspective on Oncorhynchus salmonine introductions and put-and-take fisheries based on modern stocking programs, with special emphasis on freshwater ecosystems. We survey the global introductions of nine selected salmonines of the genus Oncorhynchus: golden trout, cutthroat trout, pink salmon, chum salmon, coho salmon, masu/cherry salmon, rainbow trout/ steelhead, sockeye salmon/kokanee, and chinook salmon. The information is organized on a geographical basis by continent, and then by species and chronology. Two different objectives and associated definitions of 'success' for introductions are distinguished: (a) seed introduction: release of individuals with the purpose of creating a wild-reproducing, self-sustaining population; and (b) put-and-take introduction: release of individuals with the purpose of maintaining some level of wild population abundance, regardless of wild reproduction. We identify four major phenomena regarding global salmonine introductions: (1) general inadequacy of documentation regarding introductions; (2) a fundamental disconnect between management actions and ecological consequences of introductions; (3) the importance of global climate change on success of previous and future introductions; and (4) the significance of aquaculture as a key uncertainty in accidental introductions. We conclude this review with a recognition of the need to terminate ongoing stocking programs for introduced salmonines worldwide. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract = {The imminent demise of montane species is a recurrent theme in the climate change literature, particularly for aquatic species that are constrained to networks and elevational rather than latitudinal retreat as temperatures increase. Predictions of widespread species losses, however, have yet to be fulfilled despite decades of climate change, suggesting that trends are much weaker than anticipated and may be too subtle for detection given the widespread use of sparse water temperature datasets or imprecise surrogates like elevation and air temperature. Through application of large water-temperature databases evaluated for sensitivity to historical air-temperature variability and computationally interpolated to provide high-resolution thermal habitat information for a 222,000-km network, we estimate a less dire thermal plight for cold-water species within mountains of the northwestern United States. Stream warming rates and climate velocities were both relatively low for 1968-2011 (average warming rate=0.101 °C/decade; median velocity=1.07 km/decade) when air temperatures warmed at 0.21 °C/decade. Many cold-water vertebrate species occurred in a subset of the network characterized by low climate velocities, and three native species of conservation concern occurred in extremely cold, slow velocity environments (0.33-0.48 km/decade). Examination of aggressive warming scenarios indicated that although network climate velocities could increase, they remain low in headwaters because of strong local temperature gradients associated with topographic controls. Better information about changing hydrology and disturbance regimes is needed to complement these results, but rather than being climatic cul-de-sacs, many mountain streams appear poised to be redoubts for cold-water biodiversity this century.},

abstract = {Projects that restore river flows can be considered as in situ experiments and should be used to test predictions of the effects of flow changes on fish populations and communities. However, flow restoration projects often lack appropriate monitoring and replication. The Rh{\^{o}}ne restoration project has included repeated flow changes, in four bypassed reaches of the river, where the increase in minimum daily flow varied from minimal change to a tenfold increase. Fish communities ({\textgreater}55 000 individuals of 36 species) were electrofished at nine sites in the main channels of the four bypassed reaches, for 2-9 years before and for 5-10 years after the flow restoration. An instream hydraulic habitat model, published before restoration and based on observations of fish microhabitat preferences in independent reaches, was applied to the bypassed reaches to predict density changes for 14 species that accounted for 94{\%} of the total fish abundance. In the two bypassed reaches where minimum flow was considerably increased (fivefold and tenfold), the abundance of species preferring fast-flowing and deep microhabitats increased by factors of 1.9 and 2.4, respectively, whereas the abundance of other species strongly decreased. Predicted changes in density made using the habitat model for these two reaches agreed with the observations at several sites and involved several fish species. In contrast, in the two bypassed reaches where flow changes were less, the observed changes in density were weak and less related to the model predictions. Hydraulic habitat models predicted changes of fish populations and the predictions also explained observed community responses to the changed flows. Ten years after the first flow restoration, our results suggest that the Rh{\^{o}}ne restoration generated perennial changes of the fish community structure, reversing community patterns that were observed prior to the flow restoration.},

abstract = {Since the 1940s, snow water equivalent (SWE) has decreased throughout the Pacific Northwest, while water use has increased. Climate has been proposed as the primary cause of base-flow decline in the Scott River, an important coho salmon rearing tributary in the Klamath Basin. We took a comparative-basin approach to estimating the relative contributions of climatic and non-climatic factors to this decline. We used permutation tests to compare discharge in 5 streams and 16 snow courses between "historic" (1942-1976) and "modern" (1977-2005) time periods, defined by cool and warm phases, respectively, of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. April 1 SWE decreased significantly at most snow courses lower than 1,800 in in elevation and increased slightly at higher elevations. Correspondingly, base flow decreased significantly in the two streams with the lowest latitude-adjusted elevation and increased slightly in two higher-elevation streams. Base-flow decline in the Scott River, the only study stream heavily utilized for irrigation, was larger than that in all other streams and larger than predicted by elevation. Based on comparison with a neighboring stream draining wilderness, we estimate that 39{\%} of the observed 10 Mm(3) decline in July 1-October 22 discharge in the Scott River is explained by regional-scale climatic factors. The remainder of the decline is attributable to local factors, which include an increase in irrigation withdrawal from 48 to 103 Mm(3)/year since the 1950s.},

abstract = {The analysis of soil water partitioning in seasonally dry climates necessarily requires careful consideration of the periodic climatic forcing at the intra-annual timescale in addition to daily scale variabilities. Here, we introduce three new extensions to a stochastic soil moisture model which yields seasonal evolution of soil moisture and relevant hydrological fluxes. These approximations allow seasonal climatic forcings (e.g. rainfall and potential evapotranspiration) to be fully resolved, extending the analysis of soil water partitioning to account explicitly for the seasonal amplitude and the phase difference between the climatic forcings. The results provide accurate descriptions of probabilistic soil moisture dynamics under seasonal climates without requiring extensive numerical simulations. We also find that the transfer of soil moisture between the wet to the dry season is responsible for hysteresis in the hydrological response, showing asymmetrical trajectories in the mean soil moisture and in the transient Budyko's curves during the 'dry-down' versus the 'rewetting' phases of the year. Furthermore, in some dry climates where rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are in-phase, annual evapotranspiration can be shown to increase because of inter-seasonal soil moisture transfer, highlighting the importance of soil water storage in the seasonal context.},

abstract = {This study examines the question of how much information one can extract from a tracer-based hydrograph separation in a remote and minimally gaged alpine catchment in Chile. We combine PCA-based endmember mixing analysis to identify the sources of flow contribution to the Diguill{\'{i}}n River with a hierarchical Bayesian mixing model to integrate spatial and temporal variability in endmember concentration and quantify the source contributions to streamflow over time. The PCA-analysis shows that precipitation isotopes do not vary by elevation (e.g. snow and rainfall had identical signatures) but vary significantly by season, and that a third endmember is necessary to bound streamflow variability at the basin outlet, which was not captured by our field sampling. One of the main advantages of Bayesian methods is the quasi-machine learning capabilities, where we treated the third endmember as a parameter from which the mixing model could both estimate proportional contributions as well as posterior estimates for the tracer concentrations. The two tracer, three endmember hydrograph separation revealed groundwater to be the largest and precipitation (rain and snow) to be the smallest contributor, on average, to streamflow with the third unknown endmember contributing around 40{\%} of streamflow during the Winter wet season. We hypothesize that interflow is occurring as the third endmember in the Alto Diguill{\'{i}}n subwatershed, based on inferred tracer values and the presence of alluvium atop impermeable bedrock along certain reaches. More work is necessary to observe and sample these flowpaths, which was not possible during this study. The results of this work have implications for water resource management, since groundwater sustains the majority of streamflow in the Diguill{\'{i}}n, and climate change will impact the timing and quantity of baseflow and interflow. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of combining PCA with Bayesian statistical modeling and inference to extract maximum information from a limited field dataset in a remote alpine catchment. The findings of this work can guide future water management in the Diguill{\'{i}}n, but also provide clear questions for future research.},

abstract = {Western US forest ecosystems and downstream water supplies are reliant on seasonal snowmelt. Complex feedbacks govern forest-snow interactions in which forests influence the distribution of snow and the timing of snowmelt but are also sensitive to snow water availability. Notwithstanding, few studies have investigated the influence of forest structure on snow distribution, snowmelt and soil moisture response. Using a multi-year record from co-located observations of snow depth and soil moisture, we evaluated the influence of forest-canopy position on snow accumulation and snow depth depletion, and associated controls on the timing of soil moisture response at Boulder Creek, Colorado, Jemez River Basin, New Mexico, and the Wolverton Basin, California. Forest-canopy controls on snow accumulation led to 12-42cm greater peak snow depths in open versus under-canopy positions. Differences in accumulation and melt across sites resulted in earlier snow disappearance in open positions at Jemez and earlier snow disappearance in under-canopy positions at Boulder and Wolverton sites. Irrespective of net snow accumulation, we found that peak annual soil moisture was nearly synchronous with the date of snow disappearance at all sites with an average deviation of 12, 3 and 22days at Jemez, Boulder and Wolverton sites, respectively. Interestingly, sites in the Sierra Nevada showed peak soil moisture prior to snow disappearance at both our intensive study site and the nearby snow telemetry stations. Our results imply that the duration of soil water stress may increase as regional warming or forest disturbance lead to earlier snow disappearance and soil moisture recession in subalpine forests.},

abstract = {The utility of hydrologic indices for describing various aspects of streamflow regimes has resulted in their increased application in riverine research. Consequently, researchers are now confronted with the task of having to choose among a large number of competing hydrologic indices to reduce computational effort and variable redundancy prior to statistical analyses, while still adequately representing the major facets of the flow regime. The present study addresses this concern by providing a comprehensive review of 171 currently available hydrologic indices (including the commonly used Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration) using long-term flow records from 420 sites from across the continental USA. We highlight patterns of redundancy among these hydrologic indices and provide a number of statistically and ecologically based recommendations for the selection of a reduced set of indices that can simultaneously (1) explain a dominant proportion of statistical variation in the complete set of hydrologic indices and (2) minimize multicollinearity while still adequately representing recognized, critical attributes of the flow regime. In addition, we examine the transferability of hydrologic indices across 'stream types' by identifying indices that consistently explain dominant patterns of variance across streams in varying climatic and geologic environments. Together, our results provide a framework from which researchers can identify hydrologic indices that adequately characterize flow regimes in a non-redundant manner. In combination with ecological knowledge, this framework can guide researchers in the parsimonious selection of hydrologic indices for future hydroecological studies. {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

@article{DoremusTarlock2003,
abstract = {In the drought summer of 2001, a dramatic event occurred in the obscure Klamath region of northern California and Southern Oregon: the Bureau of Reclamation closed the headgates of the Klamath Project, halting irrigation deliveries in order to protect endangered fish. For the first time, the Endangered Species Act had caused a large-scale curtailment of water delivery from a federal project. Several months later, a National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council committee issued a report critical of the scientific basis for the decision to cut off water deliveries, fueling controversy in the already deeply polarized region. The Klamath crisis and its continuing aftermath provide an important case study of the key challenges facing many communities in the arid West: how to move beyond a long history of inefficient irrigation, remedy the ecosystem degradation that system has produced, and make the transition from a colonial commodity-production economy to a modern, globally integrated one. The Klamath is a classic degraded, unsustainable basin, exhibiting all the environmental and economic woes of the "new" West. It is also a place where the ESA, which has been widely regarded as an important tool for forcing states and local populations to take into account new social realities, has been aggressively applied. This article explores the choices that led to the Klamath crisis, the crisis itself, and its aftermath. Although there are many ways to tell the Klamath story, the narrative we find most compelling is one of a clash of cultures that must be resolved as the arid West confronts its future. Farmers, environmentalists, and Indians are all fighting to protect their ideal of the landscape and their relationship to it. A similar culture war is played out within the federal government, as the Bureau of Reclamation and the wildlife agencies fight for supremacy in the Basin. We draw several lessons from the Klamath experience, all of which we believe apply more broadly. First, the pressing question, one that is complex from both a social and a scientific perspective, is how to manage the transition to a sustainable landscape in a fair and equitable manner. The deep cultural divide between groups affected by the use of water and lands in the region, and the pervasive uncertainties about the legal rights and responsibilities of those groups, have made the transition extremely difficult. Second, overemphasis on science as the arbiter of the legal, and indirectly of the cultural, disputes has deepened the cultural divide. Science plays a major role in the resolution of environmental disputes; it is often seen as the only potential unifying standard among parties with very different world views. Unfortunately, because of data gaps, uncertainties, and disagreement about values rather than facts, science frequently does not eliminate disagreement among opposing parties. In those circumstances, the intense battle for the high scientific ground that typically results is ultimately counter-productive, diverting attention from the difficult social choices that must be made. Third, solving conflicts with deep cultural implications over water (or other limited resources) is difficult and painful, so delay and avoidance have been common tactics. The Klamath experience teaches us that delay only serves to make the conflicts sharper, and therefore more difficult to resolve, when they can no longer be avoided. That lesson goes for irrigators as well as the government agencies. Finally, a more comprehensive ecosystem-based approach than is currently available is needed to encourage and support the transition to sustainability. State and federal agencies must work toward common solutions, and resource use issues (such as water allocation) must not be treated as separable from pollution issues (such as water quality control). The ESA can catalyze, but ultimately cannot force, a move to a more comprehensive approach. We offer the process that led to the current Florida Everglades restoration experiment as one possible model for that transition.},

abstract = {We compare the projected changes to streamflows for three Sierra Nevada rivers using statistically downscaled output from 22 global climate projections. The downscaled meteorological data are used to drive two hydrology models: the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model and the variable infiltration capacity model. These two models differ in their spatial resolution, computational time step, and degree and objective of calibration, thus producing significantly different simulations of current and future streamflow. However, the projected percentage changes in monthly streamflows through mid-21st Century generally did not differ, with the exceptions of streamflow during low flow months, and extreme low flows. These findings suggest that for physically based hydrology models applied to snow-dominated basins in Mediterranean climate regimes like the Sierra Nevada, California, model formulation, resolution, and calibration are secondary factors for estimating projected changes in extreme flows (seasonal or daily). For low flows, hydrology model selection and calibration can be significant factors in assessing impacts of projected climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Water Resources Association.

abstract = {We examined the response of fishes to establishment of a new flow regime in lower Putah Creek, a regulated stream in California, USA. The new flow regime was designed to mimic the seasonal timing of natural increases and decreases in stream flow. We monitored fish assemblages annually at six sample sites distributed over ;30 km of stream for eight years before and nine years after the new flow regime was implemented. Our purpose was to determine whether more natural stream flow patterns would reestablish native fishes and reduce the abundances of alien (nonnative) fishes. At the onset of our study, native fishes were constrained to habitat immediately (,1 km) below the diversion dam, and alien species were numerically dominant at all downstream sample sites. Following implementation of the new flow regime, native fishes regained dominance across more than 20 km of lower Putah Creek. We propose that the expansion of native fishes was facilitated by creation of favorable spawning and rearing conditions (e.g., elevated springtime flows), cooler water temperatures, maintenance of lotic (flowing) conditions over the length of the creek, and displacement of alien species by naturally occurring high-discharge events. Importantly, restoration of native fishes was achieved by manipulating stream flows at biologically important times of the year and only required a small increase in the total volume of water delivered downstream (i.e., water that was not diverted for other uses) during most water years. Our results validate that natural flow regimes can be used to effectively manipulate and manage fish assemblages in regulated rivers. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Here we analyse large-ensemble and multi-model simulations that project the future of water cycle extremes in California as well as to understand those associations that pertain to changing climate oscillations under global warming. Both intense drought and excessive flooding are projected to increase by at least 50{\%} towards the end of the twenty-first century; this projected increase in water cycle extremes is associated with a strengthened relation to El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO)[mdash]in particular, extreme El Nino and La Nina events that modulate California/'s climate not only through its warm and cold phases but also its precursor patterns.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is an essential paradigm in Earth and Environmental Systems modeling. However, the term "sensitivity" has a clear definition, based in partial derivatives, only when specified locally around a particular point (e.g., optimal solution) in the problem space. Accordingly, no unique definition exists for "global sensitivity" across the problem space, when considering one or more model responses to different factors such as model parameters or forcings. A variety of approaches have been proposed for global sensitivity analysis, based on different philosophies and theories, and each of these formally characterizes a different "intuitive" understanding of sensitivity. These approaches focus on different properties of the model response at a fundamental level and may therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the underlying sensitivities. Here we revisit the theoretical basis for sensitivity analysis, summarize and critically evaluate existing approaches in the literature, and demonstrate their flaws and shortcomings through conceptual examples. We also demonstrate the difficulty involved in interpreting "global" interaction effects, which may undermine the value of existing interpretive approaches. With this background, we identify several important properties of response surfaces that are associated with the understanding and interpretation of sensitivities in the context of Earth and Environmental System models. Finally, we highlight the need for a new, comprehensive framework for sensitivity analysis that effectively characterizes all of the important sensitivity-related properties of model response surfaces.},

This is a formidable challenge that severely exacerbates the dimensionality problem already present with mean-variance analysis. This article extends the existing literature, which has mostly focused on the covariance matrix, by introducing improved estimators for the coskewness and cokurtosis parameters. We find that the use of these enhanced estimates generates a significant improvement in investors' welfare. We also find that it is only when improved estimators are used that portfolio selection with higher-order moments dominates mean-variance analysis from an out-of-sample perspective.},

abstract = {Options for increasing reservoir storage in developed regions are limited and prohibitively expensive. Projected increases in demand call for new long-term water storage to help sustain agriculture, municipalities, industry, and ecological services. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is becoming an integral component of water resources around the world. However, MAR faces challenges, including infrastructure costs, difficulty in enhancing recharge, water quality issues, and lack of available water supplies. Here we examine, through simulation modeling of a hypothetical agricultural subbasin in the western U.S., the potential of agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) via canal seepage and off-season field irrigation. Weather phenomenon in many regions around the world exhibit decadal and other multiyear cycles of extreme precipitation. An ongoing challenge is to develop approaches to store greater amounts of water during these events. Simulations presented herein incorporate Ag-MAR programs and demonstrate that there is potential to enhance regional recharge by 7–13{\%}, increase crop consumptive use by 9–12{\%}, and increase natural vegetation consumption by 20–30{\%}, where larger relative increases occur for lower aquifer hydraulic conductivity and higher specific yield values. Annual increases in groundwater levels were 7 m, and sustained levels following several years of drought were greater than 2 m. Results demonstrate that Ag-MAR has great potential to enhance long-term sustainability of water resources in agricultural basins.},

abstract = {Supplementation of wild salmonids with captive-bred fish is a common practice for both commercial and conservation purposes. However, evidence for lower fitness of captive-reared fish relative to wild fish has accumulated in recent years, diminishing the apparent effectiveness of supplementation as a management tool. To date, the mechanism(s) responsible for these fitness declines remain unknown. In this study, we showed with molecular parentage analysis that hatchery coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) had lower reproductive success than wild fish once they reproduced in the wild. This effect was more pronounced in males than in same-aged females. Hatchery spawned fish that were released as unfed fry (age 0), as well as hatchery fish raised for one year in the hatchery (released as smolts, age 1), both experienced lower lifetime reproductive success (RS) than wild fish. However, the subset of hatchery males that returned as 2-year olds (jacks) did not exhibit the same fitness decrease as males that returned as 3-year olds. Thus, we report three lines of evidence pointing to the absence of sexual selection in the hatchery as a contributing mechanism for fitness declines of hatchery fish in the wild: (i) hatchery fish released as unfed fry that survived to adulthood still had low RS relative to wild fish, (ii) age-3 male hatchery fish consistently showed a lower relative RS than female hatchery fish (suggesting a role for sexual selection), and (iii) age-2 jacks, which use a sneaker mating strategy, did not show the same declines as 3-year olds, which compete differently for females (again, implicating sexual selection). {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Tebaldi et al. [2005] present a Bayesian approach to determining probability distribution functions (PDFs) of temperature change at regional scales, from the output of a multi-model ensemble, run under the same scenario of future anthropogenic emissions. The main characteristic of the method is the formalization of the two criteria of bias and convergence that the REA method [Giorgi and Mearns, 2002] first quantified as a way of assessing model reliability. Thus, the General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) of the ensemble are combined in a way that accounts for their performance with respect to current climate and a measure of each model's agreement with the majority of the ensemble. We apply the Bayesian model to a set of transient experiments under two SRES scenarios. We focus on predictions of precipitation change, for land regions of subcontinental size. We highlight differences in the PDFs of precipitation change derived in regions where models find easy agreement, and perform well in simulating present day precipitation, compared to regions where models have large biases, and/or their future projections disagree. We compare results from the two scenarios, thus assessing the consequences of the two alternative hypotheses, and present summaries based on their averaging.

abstract = {The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years. Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long—28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

For the last glacial period, ice core stud- ies1,2 have revealed strong coupling of the largest millennial-scale warm events in Antarctica with the longest Dansgaard–Oeschger events in Greenland3–5 through the Atlantic meridional over- turning circulation6–8 . It has been unclear, however, whether the shorter Dansgaard–Oeschger events have counterparts in the shorter and less prominent Antarctic temperature variations, and whether these events are linked by the same mechanism. Here we present a glacial climate record derived from an ice core from Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, which represents South Atlantic climate at a resolution comparable with the Greenland ice core records. After methane synchronization with an ice core from North Greenland9 , the oxygen isotope record from the Dronning Maud Land ice core shows a one-to-one coupling between all Antarctic warm events and Greenland Dansgaard–Oeschger events by the bipolar seesaw6. The amplitude of the Antarctic warm events is found to be linearly dependent on the duration of the concurrent stadial in the North, suggesting that they all result from a similar reduction in the meridional overturning circulation.},

abstract = {Groundwater is the world's largest freshwater resource and is critically important for irrigation, and hence for global food security1–3. Already, unsustainable groundwater pumping exceeds recharge from precipitation and rivers4, leading to substantial drops in the levels of groundwater and losses of groundwater from its storage, especially in intensively irrigated regions5–7. When groundwater levels drop, discharges from groundwater to streams decline, reverse in direction or even stop completely, thereby decreasing streamflow, with potentially devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems. Here we link declines in the levels of groundwater that result from groundwater pumping to decreases in streamflow globally, and estimate where and when environmentally critical streamflows—which are required to maintain healthy ecosystems—will no longer be sustained. We estimate that, by 2050, environmental flow limits will be reached for approximately 42 to 79 per cent of the watersheds in which there is groundwater pumping worldwide, and that this will generally occur before substantial losses in groundwater storage are experienced. Only a small decline in groundwater level is needed to affect streamflow, making our estimates uncertain for streams near a transition to reversed groundwater discharge. However, for many areas, groundwater pumping rates are high and environmental flow limits are known to be severely exceeded. Compared to surface-water use, the effects of groundwater pumping are markedly delayed. Our results thus reveal the current and future environmental legacy of groundwater use.},

Using as input the output from large-scale dynamical climate models and observation-based data products, SD aims to provide a finer grain of detail and to mitigate systematic biases. It is generally recognized as providing added value. However, one of the key assumptions of SD is that the relationships used to train the method during a historical period are unchanged in the future, in the face of climate change. The validity of this assumption is typically quite difficult to assess in the normal course of analysis, as observations of future climate are lacking. We approach this problem using a “perfect model” experimental design in which high-resolution dynamical climate model output is used as a surrogate for both past and future observations.We find that while SD in general adds considerable value, in certain well-defined circumstances it can produce highly erroneous results.

abstract = {While the number of environmental flows and water science programmes continues to grow across the globe, there remains a critical need to better balance water availability in support of human and ecological needs and to recognise the environment as a legitimate user of water. In water-stressed areas, this recognition has resulted in friction between water users in the public and private sectors. An opportunity exists for practitioners to be on the forefront of the science determining best practices for supporting environmental water regimes. This Special Issue brings together a collection of environmental flows science and water management papers organised around three major themes: (1) method development and testing; (2) application case studies; and (3) efficacy evaluation. Contents of this Special Issue are intended to foster collaboration and broaden transferability of the information, technical tools, models and methods needed to support environmental water management programmes. The technical sophistication of methods and modelling tools, while important to the advancement of environmental water science, may come at the expense of easily interpretable outcomes that positively influence management decisions. Researchers need to be more proactive in translating the results of advanced modelling methodologies into user-friendly tools and methods. This will allow stakeholders and water managers to proactively test alternative water allocation scenarios to help address growing human water demands in the face of droughts and changes in climatic patterns. The application of environmental flows science and water management strategies cannot be done in isolation. Implementation involves a complex decision-making process that integrates ecological, hydrologic and social science across diverse multifaceted governance systems and requires active stakeholder involvement. Scientists and managers must strengthen partnerships at multiple scales to develop sensible science investment strategies so that collective knowledge can be translated into wise environmental water management decisions.},

abstract = {The contributions of oceanic and atmospheric variability to spatially widespread summer droughts in the contiguous United States (hereafter, pan-CONUS droughts) are investigated using 16-member ensembles of the Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3) forced with observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from 1856–2012. The employed SST forcing fields are either (i) global or restricted to the (ii) tropical Pacific or (iii) tropical Atlantic to isolate the impacts of these two ocean regions on pan-CONUS droughts. Model results show that SST forcing of pan-CONUS droughts originates almost entirely from the tropical Pacific because of atmospheric highs from the northern Pacific to eastern North America established by La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions, with little contribution from the tropical Atlantic. Notably, in all three model configurations, internal atmospheric variability influences pan-CONUS drought occurrence by as much or more than the ocean forcing and can alone cause pan-CONUS droughts by establishing a dominant high centered over the U.S. montane west. Similar results are found for the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5). Model results are compared to the observational record, which supports model-inferred contributions to pan-CONUS droughts from La Ni{\~{n}}as and internal atmospheric variability. While there may be an additional association with warm Atlantic SSTs in the observational record, this association is ambiguous due to the limited number of observed pan-CONUS droughts. The ambiguity thus opens the possibility that the observational results are limited by sampling over the twentieth century and not at odds with the suggested dominance of Pacific Ocean forcing in the model ensembles.},

abstract = {Groundwater overdraft is a major problem globally and has been a growing problem for California for decades. This overdraft is predominantly driven by the economic value of water for agricultural production and cities. Spurred by the recent drought, California passed legislation requiring the elimination of groundwater overdraft by 2040. This paper employs a statewide hydroeconomic optimization model to explore potential water supply effects of ending long-term groundwater overdraft in California's Central Valley for several general water policies with historical and warmer-drier climates. The model minimizes agricultural, urban scarcity, and operating costs over 82 years of historical hydrologic variability, given today's infrastructure and environmental flow constraints. The model results assess effects of overdraft and Delta policies for different climates on water deliveries, economic costs, environmental flows, water market operations, and the economic value of expanding infrastructure capacities. Prohibiting long-term overdraft leads to reduced agricultural water use and reoperations, and reduced outflows to the sea from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where water availability policies become important. In combination with a warmer-drier climate, ending overdraft further exacerbates water scarcities, increases environmental and economic costs, and increases the marginal economic value of water exports from the Delta, which are likely to worsen water conflicts and illustrate connections of California's groundwater and surface water problems. Economically useful adaptation actions include more water transfers involving the Delta, water markets, and trades; conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater; and recycled wastewater supplies for coastal urban users.},

abstract = {An important factor controlling catchment-scale water balance is the seasonal variation of climate. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the seasonal distributions of water and energy, and their interactions with the soil moisture store, on mean annual water balance in Australia at catchment scales using a stochastic model of soil moisture balance with seasonally varying forcing. The rainfall regime at 262 catchments around Australia was modeled as a Poisson process with the mean storm arrival rate and the mean storm depth varying throughout the year as cosine curves with annual periods. The soil moisture dynamics were represented by use of a single, finite water store having infinite infiltration capacity, and the potential evapotranspiration rate was modeled as an annual cosine curve. The mean annual water budget was calculated numerically using a Monte Carlo simulation. The model predicted that for a given level of climatic aridity the ratio of mean annual evapotranspiration to rainfall was larger where the potential evapotranspiration and rainfall were in phase, that is, in summer-dominant rainfall catchments, than where they were out of phase. The observed mean annual evapotranspiration ratios have opposite results. As a result, estimates of mean annual evapotranspiration from the model compared poorly with observational data. Because the inclusion of seasonally varying forcing alone was not sufficient to explain variability in the mean annual water balance, other catchment properties may play a role. Further analysis showed that the water balance was highly sensitive to the catchment-scale soil moisture capacity. Calibrations of this parameter indicated that infiltration-excess runoff might be an important process, especially for the summer-dominant rainfall catchments; most similar studies have shown that modeling of infiltration-excess runoff is not required at the mean annual timescale.},

AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used.

Nevertheless, a comprehensive framework to understand the complex seasonal rainfall regimes across multiple timescales is still lacking. Here, we formulate a global measure of seasonality, which captures the effects of both magnitude and concentration of the rainy season, and use it to identify regions across the tropics with highly seasonal rainfall regimes. By further decomposing rainfall seasonality into its magnitude, timing and duration components,we find increases in the interannual variability of seasonality over many parts of the dry tropics, implying increasing uncertainty in the intensity, arrival and duration of seasonal rainfall over the past century. We show that such increases in rainfall variabilitywere accom- panied by shifts in its seasonal magnitude, timing and duration, thus underscoring the importance of analysing seasonal rainfall regimes in a context that is most relevant to local ecological and social processe},

abstract = {Geochemical analyses of the carbonate tests calcified by foraminifera have provided much of the foundation for reconstructions of past ocean and climate conditions, and for chemostratigraphy. In particular, reconstructions of climate history (including temperature, salinity, and ice volume), ocean paleocirculation patterns, the carbon cycle, paleoproductivity, marine carbonate chemistry, and chemostratigraphy have relied on measurements of isotopic and trace element composition of foraminiferal calcium carbonate, and variations in these geochemical records through time and space. Substantial work has been done on details of traditional proxies (e.g., $\delta$18O, $\delta$13C) and on emerging proxies (e.g., $\delta$11B, $\epsilon$Nd) in recent years; hence, a new overview of these proxies provides a timely reference and educational tool. We review the geochemical proxies that utilize foraminiferal carbonate tests, including potential uses of the proxies for reconstructions through time: $\delta$18O, $\delta$13C, trace elements (Mg, Cd, Ba, Zn, B, U), 87Sr/86Sr, $\delta$26Mg, $\delta$11B, and $\epsilon$Nd. Both planktic and benthic foraminifera are included; planktic foraminifera provide information on the upper few hundred meters of the surface ocean, whereas benthic foraminifera provide information on conditions at the seafloor and in shallow porewaters, from shallow seas to deep ocean basins.},

Benthic foraminifera. Sea floor surface; most abundant in upper 1cm of sediment (epifaunal microhabitat); may live as deep as 20 cm (infaunal microhabitat); may also reside attached to sea grass and coral.

Planktic foraminifera. Certain species correlated with cooler or warmer water temp. Single species dominates at poles. Need to know preferred habitat depth/seasonality to interpret geochemical signals in their tests. There are shallow, intermediate/thermocline, and deep dwelling planktic foraminifera. Nutrients are scarce near the surface so many shallow species bear photosynthetic symbionts.

del{\_}w and del18O (isotope ratio deviation from standard for seawater and the calcium tests, respectively): water with a 16O isotope is evaporated more readily than 18O. Precip over land is 16O-enriched {\textgreater} glacial ice is enriched and {\textgreater} river runoff to oceans is enriched. For every 1 degree C increase in temp, there's a decrease in the measured del18Ocalcite value. (Because more 16O is released from ice sheets?)

16O preferentially evaporates (and falls as precip on land and ice caps). So, when the average global temp is warmer, more ice cap volume melts into the sea (and maybe there's more river runoff? Not sure how that would work out in a water balance), and the ocean collects more O16, creating a lower seawater del18O ratio that's recorded in calcite tests.

Along the same logic, there's a relationship between the del18O of seawater and global sea levels. (likely varies through time as ice sheet del18O varies).

abstract = {In the Netherlands, flood protection is a matter of national survival. In 2008, the Second Delta Committee recommended increasing legal flood protection standards at least tenfold to compensate for population and economic growth since 1953; this recommendation would have required dike improvement investments estimated at 11.5 billion euro. Our research group was charged with developing efficient flood protection standards in a more objective way. We used cost-benefit analysis and mixed-integer nonlinear programming to demonstrate the efficiency of increasing the legal standards in three critical regions only. Monte Carlo analysis confirms the robustness of this recommendation. In 2012, the state secretary of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment accepted our results as a basis for legislation. Compared to the earlier recommendation, this successful application of operations research yields both a highly significant increase in protection for these regions (in which two-thirds of the benefits of the proposed improvements accrue) and approximately 7.8 billion euro in cost savings. Our methods can also be used in decision making for other flood-prone areas worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informs.},

The Scott River rotary screw trap project has been in operation since 2000. One rotary screw trap was operated on the Scott River from February 10 to June 21, 2020 to sample all age classes of emigrating Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Mark and recapture trials were conducted multiple times per week to determine trap efficiencies and weekly population estimates. Established age-length cutoffs for each species were used to determine the age of the fish captured. In-stream conditions such as flow and water temperature were also monitored. Weekly estimates for the smolt class of all target species were compared to previous results to evaluate multi-year population trends. Additionally, using multi-year seasonal production estimates and Coho Salmon adult returns to the Scott River, adult survival and smolt production estimates were calculated. For the period sampled in 2020, we estimated that a total of 391,643 0+, and 2,000 1+ Chinook Salmon; 105 0+ and 14,628 1+ Coho Salmon; and 291,431 0+, 81,916 1+, 31,845 2+, and five 3+ steelhead trout emigrated from the Scott River.},

abstract = {Widespread groundwater overdraft in alluvial aquifer systems like the Central Valley (CV) in California, USA, has increased interest in managed aquifer recharge (MAR). Like most clastic sedimentary basins, recharge to the productive semi-confined CV aquifer system remains a challenge due to the presence of nearly ubiquitous, multiple confining units (silt and clay) that limit recharge pathways. Previous studies suggest the presence of interconnected networks of coarse-texture sand and gravel deposits that bypass regional confining units over a small fraction of the CV near the American and Cosumnes rivers. Here, variably saturated infiltration and recharge processes were simulated across a domain that includes high-resolution representation of the heterogeneous alluvial geologic architecture in this area. Results show that recharge potential is highly dependent on subsurface geologic architecture, with a nearly 2 order-of-magnitude range of recharge across the domain. Where interconnected coarse-texture recharge pathways occur, results show that these features can (1) accommodate rapid, high-volume MAR and (2) propagate widespread and rapid pressure responses over multi-kilometer distances in the semi-confined aquifer system. For all MAR simulations, results show that the majority of MAR is accommodated by filling unsaturated-zone (UZ) pore volume. Results also show that coarse-texture UZ facies (where present) accommodate the majority of MAR volume during early time, but fine-texture facies ultimately accommodate the majority of the total MAR volume, even for coarse-dominated sites. These findings highlight the large variability of MAR potential across the landscape and demonstrate the importance of fine-texture facies for accommodating MAR in alluvial aquifer systems.},

abstract = {Climate change threatens water resources in snowmelt-dependent regions by altering the fraction of snow and rain and spurring an earlier snowmelt season. The bulk of hydrological research has focused on forecasting response in streamflow volumes and timing to a shrinking snowpack; however, the degree to which subsurface storage offsets the loss of snow storage in various alpine geologic settings, i.e. the hydrogeologic buffering capacity, is still largely unknown. We address this research need by assessing the affects of climate change on storage and runoff generation for two distinct hydrogeologic settings present in alpine systems: a low storage granitic and a greater storage volcanic hillslope. We use a physically based integrated hydrologic model fully coupled to a land surface model to run a base scenario and then three progressive warming scenarios, and account for the shifts in each component of the water budget. For hillslopes with greater water retention, the larger storage volcanic hillslope buffered streamflow volumes and timing, but at the cost of greater reductions in groundwater storage relative to the low storage granite hillslope. We found that the results were highly sensitive to the unsaturated zone retention parameters, which in the case of alpine systems can be a mix of matrix or fracture flow. The presence of fractures and thus less retention in the unsaturated zone significantly decreased the reduction in recharge and runoff for the volcanic hillslope in climate warming scenarios. This approach highlights the importance of incorporating physically based subsurface flow in to alpine hydrology models, and our findings provide ways forward to arrive at a conceptual model that is both consistent with geology and hydrologic principles.

abstract = {Vulnerability-based frameworks are increasingly used to better understand water system performance under climate change. This work advances the use of stochastic weather generators for climate vulnerability assessments that simulate weather based on patterns of regional atmospheric flow (i.e., weather regimes) conditioned on global-scale climate features. The model is semiparametric by design and includes (1) a nonhomogeneous Markov chain for weather regime simulation; (2) block bootstrapping and a Gaussian copula for multivariate, multisite weather simulation; and (3) modules to impose thermodynamic and dynamical climate change, including Clausius-Clapeyron precipitation scaling, elevation-dependent warming, and shifting dynamics of the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this way, the model can be used to evaluate climate impacts on water systems based on hypotheses of dynamic and thermodynamic climate change. The model is developed and tested for cold-season climate in the Tuolumne River Basin in California but is broadly applicable across the western United States. Results show that eight weather regimes exert strong influences over local climate in the Tuolumne Basin. Model simulations adequately preserve many of the historical statistics for precipitation and temperature across sites, including the mean, variance, skew, and extreme values. Annual precipitation and temperature are somewhat underdispersed, and precipitation spell statistics are negatively biased by 1-2 days. For simulations of future climate, the model can generate a range of Clausius-Clapeyron scaling relationships and modes of elevation-dependent warming. Model simulations also suggest a muted response of Tuolumne climate to changes in ENSO variability.},

abstract = {Many frameworks have been used to identify environmental flows for sustaining river ecosystems or specific taxa in the face of widespread flow alteration. However, these frameworks largely focus on identifying suitable flows and often ignore the important links between management actions, resulting flows, and valued ecosystem or social responses. Structured decision making (SDM) could assist the comparison of environmental flows by providing a mature framework to link management actions to objectives via environmental flow science. We describe SDM and illustrate its application using a case study focused on comparing environmental flow scenarios for the mainstem Willamette River, Oregon. In a short timeframe, SDM was applied to identify objectives, develop empirical and expert opinion-based models, and compare flow scenarios while accounting for interannual flow variability and partial controllability. No scenario was clearly preferred based on available knowledge, largely because river flows could only be partially controlled through dam operations. Participants agreed that SDM was useful for comparing alternative dam operations, but that refined predictive models and additional objectives were needed to better inform basinwide flow decisions. In our view, SDM can provide more realistic comparisons of environmental flows by accounting for partial controllability and uncertainty, which may result in greater implementation of available flow management actions.},

A revised description of runofi processes in forested headwaters relates quick rises in streamflow to variable source areas and subsurface translatory flow, or the rapid displacement of stored water by new rain. Because this makes the classification of hydrograph com- ponents difficult, if not impossible, a numerical rating system, the response factor, was developed from precipitation and streamflow records for use in classifying the hydrologic response of small watersheds in humid areas. A simple uniform hydrograph separation method was necessary to make inter-watershed and inter-regional comparison of response meaningful. Long-term hydrograph records from fifteen forested watersheds in eastern United States were separated into quick and delayed flow by computer and ranked according to mean precipitation, quick flow, and the response factors quick flowiprecipitation and quick flowitotal water yield. Similar data from nine agricultural watersheds allowed comparison of response among twenty-four small basins, systematically revealing important relationships not usually noted. The over-riding prevalence of subsurface flow was indicated and exceptions were pinpointed. Possibilities and advantages of mapping small watersheds or stream networks by a universal response factor were discussed. STREAMFLOW},

Meeting the SDGs for water requires an integrated approach to managing and allocating water resources, by involving all actors and stakeholders, and considering how water resources link different sectors of society. To date, water management practice is dominated by technocratic, scenario-based approaches that may work well in the short term but can result in unintended consequences in the long term due to limited accounting of dynamic feedbacks between the natural, technical, and social dimensions of human-water systems. The discipline of sociohydrology has an important role to play in informing policy by developing a generalizable understanding of phenomena that arise from interactions between water and human systems. To explain these phenomena, sociohydrology must address several scientific challenges to strengthen the field and broaden its scope. These include engagement with social scientists to accommodate social heterogeneity, power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly influence the way in which people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. It also requires development of new methods to formulate and test alternative hypotheses for the explanation of emergent phenomena generated by feedbacks between water and society. Advancing sociohydrology in these ways therefore represents a major contribution toward meeting the targets set by the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time.},

The WEAP system includes a dynamically integrated rainfall runoff hydrology module that generates the components of the hydrologic cycle from input climate time series. This allows for direct simulation of water management responses to climate change without resorting to perturbations of historically observed hydrologic conditions. In the Sacramento River Basin, the four climate time series adopted for the 2006 Climate Change Report were used to simulate agricultural water management without any adaptation and with adaptation in terms of improvements in irrigation efficiency and shifts in cropping patterns during dry periods. These adaptations resulted in lower overall water demands in the agriculturalsector, to levels observed during the recent past, and associated reductions in groundwater pumping and increases in surface water allocations to other water use sectors. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2007.},

Contributions confront the grand challenge for environmental flows and water management in the Anthropocene—the urgent need for innovations that will help to sustain the innate resilience of social–ecological systems under dynamic and uncertain environmental and societal futures. Basin-scale and regional assessments of flow requirements mark a necessary advance in environmental water science in the face of rapid changes in water-resource management activities worldwide (e.g. increases in dams, diversions, retention and reuse). Techniques for regional-scale hydrological and ecohydrological modelling support ecological risk assessment and identification of priority flow management and river restoration actions. Changing flood–drought cycles, long-term climatic shifts and associated effects on hydrological, thermal and water quality regimes add enormous uncertainty to the prediction of future ecological outcomes, regardless of environmental water allocations. An improved capacity to predict the trajectories of ecological change in rivers degraded by legacies of past impact interacting with current conditions and future climate change is essential. Otherwise, we risk unrealistic expectations from restoration of river and estuarine flow regimes. A more robust, dynamic and predictive approach to environmental water science is emerging. It encourages the measurement of process rates (e.g. birth rate, colonisation rate) and species traits (e.g. physiological requirements, morphological adaptations) as well as ecosystem states (e.g. species richness, assemblage structure), as the variables representing ecological responses to flow variability and environmental water allocations. Another necessary development is the incorporation of other environmental variables such as water temperature and sedimentary processes in flow–ecological response models. Based on contributions to this Special Issue, several recent compilations and the wider literature, we identify six major scientific challenges for further exploration, and seven themes for advancing the management of environmental water. We see the emerging frontier of environmental flows and water science as urgent and challenging, with numerous opportunities for reinvigorated science and methodological innovation in the expanding enterprise of environmental water linked to ecological sustainability and social well-being.},

abstract = {Women with renal transplants have restoration of fertility with improved kidney function; however, pregnancy rates in renal transplant recipients appear to be lower than the general population, which might be influenced by patient choice. Women with renal transplants need to evaluate potential neonatal outcomes, graft outcomes, and risks to their own health to make informed decisions about conception. Pregnancy should be carefully planned in renal transplant recipients to reduce risk for graft loss, optimize pregnancy outcomes, and ensure immunosuppression regimes are nonteratogenic. Neonatal outcomes remain significantly worse for women with renal transplants than healthy controls, particularly for those with reduced graft function, hence prepregnancy, antenatal, and postpartum care of women with renal transplants should be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nephrologists and specialist obstetricians.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017},

abstract = {Separating effects of climate change ($\delta$. Qc) and human activity ($\delta$. Qh) on stream discharge at the watershed scale is needed for developing adaptive measures to climate change. However, information is scarce in existing literature regarding whether such separating is feasible and whether reliable results can be produced. The objectives of this overview were to: (1) compare currently-used methods; (2) assess assumptions and issues of the methods; and (3) present a generic framework that overcomes possible issues. Based on the overview of fifteen recent representative studies, two methods can be used to estimate absolute magnitudes of $\delta$. Qc and $\delta$. Qh, while another method can be used to distinguish relative magnitudes of $\delta$. Qc versus $\delta$. Qh only. Because the methods' fundamental assumptions about baseline versus altered period, water storage change and deep groundwater loss, precipitation-runoff relationship, hysteresis influence of human activity, and record of time series can seldom be satisfied for many watersheds, it is more realistic and practical to distinguish relative effects than to estimate absolute magnitudes of $\delta$. Qc and $\delta$. Qh. Moreover, a generic framework was presented for gauged watersheds with negligible groundwater loss, aiming to avoid misuse of the methods in practice. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A hydro-economic approach for planning on-farm managed aquifer recharge is developed and demonstrated for two contiguous sub-basins in California's Central Valley, USA. The amount and timing of water potentially available for recharge is based on a reoperation study for a nearby surface-water reservoir. Privately owned cropland is intermittently used for recharge with payments to landowners that compensate for perceived risks to crop health and productivity. Using all cropland in the study area would have recharged approximately 4.8 km3 (3,900 thousand acre-feet) over the 20-year analysis period. Limits to recharge effectiveness are expected from (1) temporal variability in recharge water availability, (2) variations in infiltration rate and few high-infiltration recharge sites in the study area, and (3) recharged water escaping from the study area groundwater system to surface water and adjacent sub-basins. Depending on crop tolerance to ponding depth, these limitations might be reduced by (1) raising berm heights on higher-infiltration-rate croplands and (2) creating dedicated recharge facilities over high-infiltration-rate sites.},

abstract = {The natural flow regime (i.e. magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change of flow events) is crucial for maintaining freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services. Protecting instream flow from anthropogenic alterations first requires an understanding of the relationship between aquatic organisms and the flow regime. In this study, we used a unique framework based on random forest modeling to quantify effects of natural flow regime metrics on fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages across ecoregions and flow regime types in the state of South Carolina, USA. We found that all components of the natural flow regime affected both fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, suggesting that maintaining natural aspects of all flow regime components is critical for protecting freshwater diversity. We identified hydrologic metrics and flow regime components such as magnitude, frequency, and duration of flow events, that were associated with the greatest ecological responses for individual stream classes to help managers prioritize hydrologic and biological metrics of interest during environmental flow standard development. The response of aquatic organisms to hydrologic metrics varied across stream classifications and ecoregions, highlighting the importance of accounting for differences in flow regime and ecoregion when designing environmental flow standards. We provide a flexible framework based on statistical flow-ecology relationships that can be used to inform instream flow management and assess effects of flow alteration on riverine assemblages.},

abstract = {An economic-engineering optimization model of California's major water supply system is presented. The model's development, calibration, limitations, and results are reviewed. The major methodological conclusions are that large-scale water resources optimization models driven by economic objective functions are both possible and practical; deterministic models are useful despite their limitations; and data management, reconciliation, and documentation are important benefits of large-scale system modeling. Specific results for California indicate a great potential for water markets and conjunctive use to improve economic performance and significant economic value for expanding some conveyance facilities. Overall, economic-engineering optimization (even if deterministic) can suggest a variety of promising approaches for managing large systems. These approaches can then be refined and tested using more detailed simulation models. The process of developing large-scale models also motivates the systematic and integrated treatment of surface water, groundwater, facility, and water demand data, and identification of particularly important data problems, something of long-term value for all types of water resources analysis.},

@article{Brown1994,
abstract = {The southernmost populations of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutcn occur in Cal- ifornia where native coho stocks have declined or disappeared from all streams in which they were historically recorded. Coho salmon previously occurred in as many as 582 streams, from the Smith River near the Oregon border to the San Lorenzo River on the central coast. Information on the recent presence or absence of coho salmon was available for only 248 (43{\%}) of those streams. Of these 248 streams, 54{\%} still contained coho salmon and 46{\%} did not. The farther south a stream is located, the more likely it is to have lost its coho salmon population. We estimate that the total number of adult coho salmon entering California streams in 1987-1991 averaged around 31,000 fish per year, with hatchery populations making up 57{\%} of this total. Thus, about 13,000 non- hatchery coho salmon have been spawning in California streams each year since 1987, an estimate that includes naturalized stocks containing about 9,000 fish of recent hatchery ancestry. There are now probably less than 5,000 native coho salmon (with no known hatchery ancestry) spawning in California each year, many of them in populations ofless than 100 individuals. Coho populations today are probably less than 6{\%} of what they were in the I940s, and there has been at least a 70{\%} decline since the 1960s. There is every reason to believe that California coho populations, including hatchery stocks, will continue to decline. The reasons for the decline of coho salmon in California include: stream alterations brought about by poor land-use practices (especially those related to logging and urbanization) and by the effects of periodic floods and drought, the breakdown of genetic integrity of native stocks, introduced diseases, overharvest, and climatic change. We believe that coho salmon in California qualify for listing as a threatened species under state law, and certain populations may qualify for listing as threatened or endangered under federal law.},

@article{Huntington2006,
abstract = {One of the more important questions in hydrology is: if the climate warms in the future, will there be an intensification of the water cycle and, if so, the nature of that intensification? There is considerable interest in this question because an intensification of the water cycle may lead to changes in water-resource availability, an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms, floods, and droughts, and an amplification of warming through the water vapor feedback. Empirical evidence for ongoing intensification of the water cycle would provide additional support for the theoretical framework that links intensification with warming. This paper briefly reviews the current state of science regarding historical trends in hydrologic variables, including precipitation, runoff, tropospheric water vapor, soil moisture, glacier mass balance, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and growing season length. Data are often incomplete in spatial and temporal domains and regional analyses are variable and sometimes contradictory; however, the weight of evidence indicates an ongoing intensification of the water cycle. In contrast to these trends, the empirical evidence to date does not consistently support an increase in the frequency or intensity of tropical storms and floods. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Projections of meteorology downscaled from global climate model runs were used to drive a model of unimpaired hydrology of the Sacramento/San Joaquin watershed, which in turn drove models of operational responses and managed flows. Twenty daily climate change scenarios for water years 1980–2099 were evaluated with the goal of producing inflow boundary conditions for a watershed sediment model and for a hydrodynamical model of the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. The resulting time series of meteorology, snowpack, unimpaired flow, reservoir storage, and managed flow were analyzed for century-scale trends. In the Sacramento basin, which dominates Bay-Delta inflows, all 20 scenarios portrayed warming trends (with a mean of 4.1 °C) and most had precipitation increases (with a mean increase of 9{\%}). Sacramento basin snowpack water equivalent declined sharply (by 89{\%}), which was associated with a major shift toward earlier unimpaired runoff timing (33{\%} more flow arriving prior to 1 April). Sacramento basin reservoirs showed large declines in end-of-September storage. Water-year averaged outflows increased for most scenarios for both unimpaired and impaired flows, and frequency of extremely high daily unimpaired and impaired flows increased (increases of 175{\%} and 170{\%}, respectively). Managed Delta inflows were projected to experience large increases in the wet season and declines in the dry season. Changes in management strategy and infrastructure can mitigate some of these changes, though to what degree is uncertain.},

During warm periods, groundwater-surface water interactions have two primary effects on stream temperature: (1) cool groundwater discharging as baseflow lowers stream temperature and (2) hyporheic exchange buffers diurnal stream temperature variations. We demonstrate, for the first time, how high-resolution, remotely sensed forward-looking infrared (FLIR) images and instream temperature data can be used to quantify detailed spatial patterns of groundwater discharge to a 1.7 km reach of Cottonwood Creek in Plumas National Forest, CA. We quantify the individual effects of baseflow and hyporheic exchange on stream temperatures by simulating the stream energy budget under different conceptual models of the stream-aquifer interaction. Observed spatial and temporal patterns of stream temperature are consistent with an increase in baseflow and hyporheic exchange within the middle, restored stream reach when compared to groundwater fluxes in the surrounding, unrestored reaches. One implication is that pond and plug stream restoration may improve the aquatic habitat by depressing maximum stream temperatures by {\textgreater}3 °C (K). {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Macroinvertebrates' response to hydromorphological alterations and regulated flows along lowland rivers is still poorly known despite ecohydrology's fundamental role in river science. Along the Oglio River (Northern Italy), several water abstractions and dams break it into segments with varying hydraulic and morphological properties. Three types of a priori different environments were identified (dammed, downstream and free flowing sections), and macroinvertebrate communities were sampled from each zone. This study aimed (i) to investigate patterns of macroinvertebrate communities along a regulated lowland river by testing the a priori zones; (ii) to find macroinvertebrate taxa that served as indicators of the various hydrological conditions and (iii) to verify hydromorphological control over ecological macroinvertebrate traits resulting in different trait values in each identified zone. Macroinvertebrate community was characterized in a total of 63 stations by means of two quantitative approaches, each exploring a surface of 0.5m2. The lowest richness values were found in dammed sites that tended toward lentic conditions. Ecnomidae (dammed zones), Limoniidae (downstream zones) and Heptageniidae (free flowing section) were identified as the best indicators of varying hydrological conditions. As suggested by the results of 4th Corner Method, environmental constraints define communities with different ecological traits. These results highlight hydromorphological control over macroinvertebrate community structure and reflect how regulated flows affect the Oglio River in terms of biodiversity, indicator taxa and ecological traits. The authors wish to stress the importance of considering the ecological effects of dams and impoundments on river systems in upstream areas as well as downstream. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The argument is made that the potential for multiple acceptable models as representations of hydrological and other environmental systems (the equifinality thesis) should be given more serious consideration than hitherto. It proposes some techniques for an extended GLUE methodology to make it more rigorous and outlines some of the research issues still to be resolved. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Effective science-based management of water resources in large basins requires a qualitative understanding of hydrologic conditions and quantitative measures of the various components of the water budget, including difficult to measure components such as baseflow discharge to streams. Using widely available discharge and continuously collected specific conductance (SC) data, we adapted and applied a long established chemical hydrograph separation approach to quantify daily and representative annual baseflow discharge at 14 streams and rivers at large spatial ({\textgreater} 1000 km2 watersheds) and temporal (up to 37 years) scales in the Upper Colorado River Basin. On average, annual baseflow was 21–58{\%} of annual stream discharge, 13–45{\%} of discharge during snowmelt, and 40–86{\%} of discharge during low-flow condi- tions. Results suggest that reservoirs may act to store baseflow discharged to the stream during snowmelt and release that baseflow during low-flow conditions, and that irrigation return flows may contribute to increases in fall baseflow in heavily irrigated watersheds. The chemical hydrograph separation approach, and associated conceptual model defined here provide a basis for the identification of land use, manage- ment, and climate effects on baseflow},

abstract = {A new two-moment stratiform cloud microphysics scheme in a general circulation model is described. Prognostic variables include cloud droplet and cloud ice mass mixing ratios and number concentrations. The scheme treats several microphysical processes, including hydrometeor collection, condensation/ evaporation, freezing, melting, and sedimentation. The activation of droplets on aerosol is physically based and coupled to a subgrid vertical velocity. Unique aspects of the scheme, relative to existing two-moment schemes developed for general circulation models, are the diagnostic treatment of rain and snow number concentration and mixing ratio and the explicit treatment of subgrid cloud water variability for calculation of the microphysical process rates. Numerical aspects of the scheme are described in detail using idealized one-dimensional offline tests of the microphysics. Sensitivity of the scheme to time step, vertical resolution, and numerical method for diagnostic precipitation is investigated over a range of conditions. It is found that, in general, two substeps are required for numerical stability and reasonably small time truncation errors using a time step of 20 min; however, substepping is only required for the precipitation microphysical processes rather than the entire scheme. A new numerical approach for the diagnostic rain and snow produces reasonable results compared to a benchmark simulation, especially at low vertical resolution. Part II of this study details results of the scheme in single-column and global simulations, including comparison with observations.},

abstract = {This study combines major ion and isotope chemistry, age tracers, fracture density characterizations, and physical hydrology measurements to understand how the structure of the critical zone (CZ) influences its function, including water routing, storage, mean water residence times, and hydrologic response. In a high elevation rhyolitic tuff catchment in the Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory (JRB-CZO) within the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP) of northern New Mexico, a periodic precipitation pattern creates different hydrologic flow regimes during spring snowmelt, summer monsoon rain, and fall storms. Hydrometric, geochemical, and isotopic analyses of surface water and groundwater from distinct stores, most notably shallow groundwater that is likely a perched aquifer in consolidated collapse breccia and deeper groundwater in a fractured tuff aquifer system, enabled us to untangle the interactions of these groundwater stores and their contribution to streamflow across 1 complete water year (WY). Despite seasonal differences in groundwater response due to water partitioning, major ion chemistry indicates that deep groundwater from the highly fractured site is more representative of groundwater contributing to streamflow across the entire water year. Additionally, the comparison of streamflow and groundwater hydrographs indicates a hydraulic connection between the fractured welded tuff aquifer system and streamflow, while the shallow aquifer within the collapse breccia deposit does not show this same connection. Furthermore, analysis of age tracers and oxygen ($\delta$18O) and stable hydrogen ($\delta$2H) isotopes of water indicates that groundwater is a mix of modern and older waters recharged from snowmelt, and downhole neutron probe surveys suggest that water moves through the vadose zone both by vertical infiltration and subsurface lateral flow, depending on the lithology. We find that in complex geologic terrain like that of the JRB-CZO, differences in the CZ architecture of two hillslopes within a headwater catchment control water stores and routing through the subsurface and suggest that shallow groundwater does not contribute significantly to streams, while deep fractured aquifer systems contribute most to streamflow.},

abstract = {Introduction: Resource managers need spatially explicit models of hydrologic response to changes in key climatic drivers across variable landscape conditions. We demonstrate the utility of a Basin Characterization Model for California (CA-BCM) to integrate high-resolution data on physical watershed characteristics with historical or projected climate data to predict watershed-specific hydrologic responses. Methods: The CA-BCM applies a monthly regional water-balance model to simulate hydrologic responses to climate at the spatial resolution of a 270-m grid. The model has been calibrated using a total of 159 relatively unimpaired watersheds for the California region. Results: As a result of calibration, predicted basin discharge closely matches measured data for validation watersheds. The CA-BCM recharge and runoff estimates, combined with estimates of snowpack and timing of snowmelt, provide a basis for assessing variations in water availability. Another important output variable, climatic water deficit, integrates the combined effects of temperature and rainfall on site-specific soil moisture, a factor that plants may respond to more directly than air temperature and precipitation alone. Model outputs are calculated for each grid cell, allowing results to be summarized for a variety of planning units including hillslopes, watersheds, ecoregions, or political boundaries. Conclusions: The ability to confidently calculate hydrologic outputs at fine spatial scales provides a new suite of hydrologic predictor variables that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as projections of changes in water availability, environmental demand, or distribution of plants and habitats. Here we present the framework of the CA-BCM model for the California hydrologic region, a test of model performance on 159 watersheds, summary results for the region for the 1981-2010 time period, and changes since the 1951-1980 time period. {\textcopyright} 2013 Flint et al.},

The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) of 2014 seeks to maintain groundwater discharge to streams to support environmental goals. In Scott Valley, in Siskiyou County, the Scott River and its tributaries are an important salmonid spawning habitat, and about 10{\%} of average annual Scott River stream flow comes from groundwater. The local groundwater advisory committee is developing groundwater management alternatives that would increase summer and early fall stream flows. We developed a model to provide a framework to evaluate those alternatives. We first created a water budget for the Scott Valley groundwater basin and integrated the detailed, spatiotemporally distributed water budget results into a computer model of the basin that simultaneously accounted for groundwater flow, stream flow and landscape water fluxes. Different conceptual representations (using the MODFLOW RIV package and MODFLOW SFR package) of the stream–aquifer boundary provided significantly different results in the seasonal dynamics of groundwater–surface water fluxes. As groundwater sustainability agencies draw up plans to meet SGMA requirements, they must choose and test simulation tools carefully.},

abstract = {All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate-for example, on the frequency of heatwaves-this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability-predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions-are likely to be severe. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {[1] The water distribution system (WDS) design problem is defined here as a multiobjective optimization problem under uncertainty. The two objectives are (1) minimize the total WDS design cost and (2) maximize WDS robustness. The WDS robustness is defined as the probability of simultaneously satisfying minimum pressure head constraints at all nodes in the network. Decision variables are the alternative design options for each pipe in the network. The sources of uncertainty are future water consumption and pipe roughness coefficients. Uncertain variables are modeled using probability density functions (PDFs) assigned in the problem formulation phase. The corresponding PDFs of the analyzed nodal heads are calculated using the Latin hypercube sampling technique. The optimal design problem is solved using the newly developed RNSGAII method based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII). In RNSGAII a small number of samples are used for each fitness evaluation, leading to significant computational savings when compared to the full sampling approach. Chromosome fitness is defined here in the same way as in the NSGAII optimization methodology. The new methodology is tested on several cases, all based on the New York tunnels reinforcement problem. The results obtained demonstrate that the new methodology is capable of identifying robust Pareto optimal solutions despite significantly reduced computational effort.

abstract = {This report describes the historical population structure of coho salmon in the Southern Oregon/Northern California (SONCC) Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) that includes coastal watersheds from Elk River (Oregon) in the north to Mattole River (California) in the south. Developing an understanding of historical population structure of populations within an ESU is a prerequisite in recovery planning that ultimately results in the development of biological viability criteria. These viability criteria, and the analyses from which they stem, must refer to specific populations and population groups (i.e., populations or groups of populations within a ESU). Types of information we considered in this report included historical distribution, geographic isolation, dispersal rates, genetic data, life history information, population dynamics, and environmental and ecological diversity. Our analysis of historical population structure was strongly constrained by the lack of data available for consideration; however our approach was intentionally consistent with the approaches taken by Technical Recovery Teams (TRTs) working in more data-rich areas of California and the Pacific Northwest (Currens et al. 2002; Lawson et al. 2006). Because of this lack of data, our determination of historical population structure of SONCC Coho Salmon ESU was based primarily on a simple conceptual model of spatially dependent demographics of 50 populations considered to be historically present. Readers interested in the conclusions and specific population designations can refer to Table 1 (page 26), and Figures 8 and 9 (pages 40 and 46). In general, the historical population structure of coho salmon in the SONCC ESU was characterized by small-to-moderate-sized coastal basins where high quality habitat is in the lower portions of the basin and by three large basins where high quality habitat was located in the lower portions, middle portions of the basins provided little habitat, and the largest amount of habitat was located in the upper portions of the sub-basins. Nineteen populations that were determined to have minimal demographic influence from adjacent populations and were viable-in-isolation were classified as Functionally Independent populations. Twelve populations that appeared to have been viable-in-isolation but were demographically influenced by adjacent populations were classified as Potentially Independent populations. Small populations of coho salmon that do not have a high likelihood of sustaining themselves over a 100-year time period in isolation and receive sufficient immigration to alter their dynamics and extinction risk were classified as Dependent (17 populations). Two populations were determined to be Ephemeral (Hubbard and Euchre creeks). Ephemeral populations do not have a high likelihood of sustaining themselves over a 100-year time period in isolation, and do not receive sufficient immigration to affect this likelihood. In addition, the habitat supporting an Ephemeral population is expected to be occupied only rarely. In anticipation of developing of viability criteria at the population scale and integration of population information into viability criteria at the ESU scale, we identify groups of populations that span the diversity and distribution that currently exists or historically existed within the ESU. We refer to these groups as ‘diversity strata' to reflect our primary focus on the issue of diversity, broadly defined, as the basis for delineating these groups. The TRT organized the independent and dependent populations of coho salmon in the SONCC ESU into diversity strata largely based on the geographical arrangement of the populations and basin-scale environmental and ecological characteristics.},

abstract = {Understanding the links between instream ecology and hydrology has become a critical task in contemporary river research and management. Habitat selection behaviour is a central dimension in applied ecology because it is a primary way that mobile organisms adapt to changing environmental conditions. Here, we analyzed brown trout habitat selection during two consecutive years in rivers presenting contrasting flow conditions to test the following hypotheses: (1) given that adaptation to flow regimes occurs as a response to the interaction between frequency, magnitude and predictability of mortality-causing events, habitat selection would vary across populations subject to different disturbance regimes; (2) because adaptations are directed towards enduring both intra-annual and interannual variations in flow, habitat selection would shift across years as a response to changing flow conditions and (3) such responses to yearly flow fluctuations would depend on the historical long-term hydrologic regime. We found that trout from rivers with highly variable flow and more frequent, longer and stronger extreme flow events were more willing to occupy positions in high-velocity habitats and showed stronger requirements for velocity refuges, whereas trout inhabiting more stable and benign flow environments selected visually-covered habitats to minimize biotic interactions. Results also revealed that trout shifted habitat selection patterns across years differing in flow conditions irrespective of river typology, but this shift was markedly stronger in rivers with higher flow variability and extremity. Overall, observed ecological patterns have strong implications for predicting the consequences of flow alteration for species adapted to particular flow regimes. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Alternative land uses make different contributions to the conservation of biodiversity and have different implementation and management costs. Conservation planning analyses to date have generally assumed that land is either protected or unprotected and that the unprotected portion does not contribute to conservation goals. We develop and apply a new planning approach that explicitly accounts for the contribution of a diverse range of land uses to achieving conservation goals. Using East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) as a case study, we prioritize investments in alternative conservation strategies and account for the relative contribution of land uses ranging from production forest to well-managed protected areas. We employ data on the distribution of mammals and assign species-specific conservation targets to achieve equitable protection by accounting for life history characteristics and home range sizes. The relative sensitivity of each species to forest degradation determines the contribution of each land use to achieving targets. We compare the cost effectiveness of our approach to a plan that considers only the contribution of protected areas to biodiversity conservation, and to a plan that assumes that the cost of conservation is represented by only the opportunity costs of conservation to the timber industry. Our preliminary results will require further development and substantial stakeholder engagement prior to implementation; nonetheless we reveal that, by accounting for the contribution of unprotected land, we can obtain more refined estimates of the costs of conservation. Using traditional planning approaches would overestimate the cost of achieving the conservation targets by an order of magnitude. Our approach reveals not only where to invest, but which strategies to invest in, in order to effectively and efficiently conserve biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {We studied benthic macroinvertebrate communities in 12 mid-elevation mountain streams in the Sierra Nevada, California. Data were collected at nine times (seven springs and two autumns) over a 14-year period of variable hydrological conditions, including years of flood and extreme unprecedented drought. The taxonomic and trait structures of communities were similar during wet and average springs but became increasingly different as drought continued and smaller streams became intermittent. The density of total invertebrates, primarily chironomids, increased during the drought years, but the richness and abundance of mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly (EPT) taxa declined during the late drought. During the late drought, the proportions of rheophilic, semivoltine taxa with clinger or swimmer behavioural habits decreased, whereas small, stress-tolerant taxa with burrower and climber habits increased. Collector–gatherers dominated in all periods, but during the severe drought the relative abundance of micropredators increased and filterers, shredders, and grazers decreased. We also found greater changes in community structure between spring runoff and autumn base flow conditions in an average than a wet year. However, spring to autumn population growth rates were much greater during the wet than average year. Invertebrate richness and EPT abundance decreased and community structure showed large changes when stream discharge fell below 1–10 L/s, but remained relatively constant across a range of higher flows. During the severe drought, there were significant declines in the densities of 40{\%} of the common EPT taxa compared to average and wet years, but chironomid, mite, and other invertebrate taxa showed variable responses. Invertebrate diversity, community structure, and ecosystem functions in small, headwater streams are especially vulnerable to drought conditions, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change in the Sierra Nevada and other mountainous regions.},

abstract = {Abstract A uniform, global approach is used to quantify how atmospheric rivers (ARs) change between Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 historical simulations and future projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 warming scenarios. The projections indicate that while there will be {\~{}}10{\%} fewer ARs in the future, the ARs will be {\~{}}25{\%} longer, {\~{}}25{\%} wider, and exhibit stronger integrated water vapor transports (IVTs) under RCP8.5. These changes result in pronounced increases in the frequency (IVT strength) of AR conditions under RCP8.5: {\~{}}50{\%} (25{\%}) globally, {\~{}}50{\%} (20{\%}) in the northern midlatitudes, and {\~{}}60{\%} (20{\%}) in the southern midlatitudes. The models exhibit systematic low biases across the midlatitudes in replicating historical AR frequency ({\~{}}10{\%}), zonal IVT ({\~{}}15{\%}), and meridional IVT ({\~{}}25{\%}), with sizable intermodel differences. A more detailed examination of six regions strongly impacted by ARs suggests that the western United States, northwestern Europe, and southwestern South America exhibit considerable intermodel differences in projected changes in ARs.},

Notable is the degree that California, the UK, and Chile stand out among these regions in the uncertainty of simulated AR frequency for the historical period and projected changes in AR frequency and IVT.},

It is found that it would take a library of order 1030 years to find 2 observed flows that match to within current observational error over a large area such as the Northern Hemisphere. Obviously, with only 10–100 years of data, the probability of finding natural analogous is very small, unless one is satisfied with analogy over small areas or in just 2 of 3 degrees of freedom as represented, for instance, by 2 or 3 leading empirical orthogonal modes. We further propose the notion that analogues can be constructed by combining a number of observed flow patterns. We have found at least one application where linearly constructed analogues are conclusively better at specifying US surface weather from concurrent 700 mb geopotential height than natural analogues are.},

abstract = {The objective of the study reported herein is to develop practical procedures for the analysis of a multiple purpose, multiple facility reservoir system to guide real time decisions concerning the optimal operation of the system. Application is made to the California Central Valley Project (CVP). The five purposes (benefits), treated as objectives here in the multiobjective optimization, include (1) hydropower production, (2) fish protection, (3) water quality maintenance, (4) water supply, and (5) recreation. The constraint method is used to develop the trade‐offs while a specially modified linear programing and dynamic programing algorithm is used for optimization. Noninferior sets can be obtained with each benefit parameterized singly and in various combinations. Two sets of monthly historical streamflows, one set corresponding to a drought year and the other set to an excess water year, are used to develop the corresponding noninferior sets. These procedures provide guidance for allocating the total benefits derived from a region's water resources and for operating the available system within all statutory, contractual, and other applicable constraints. A very high degree of decomposition of the typically large multiple purpose, multiple facility operation problem is made possible by the above technique, resulting in a rapid delineation of the noninferior policy set. The decision maker participates at various stages of the analysis and can request more or less detail with regard to the noninferior set. In our opinion, information is best presented to him via a series of two dimensional plots representing various cross sections of the noninferior set. Tabular presentations are not conducive to a good appreciation of the consequences of alternative benefit allocation policies. Copyright 1982 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Process-based models that link climate and hydrology permit improved assessments of climate change impacts among watersheds. We used the Basin Characterization Model (BCM), a regional water balance model to (1) ask what is the magnitude of historical and projected future change in the hydrology of California's watersheds; (2) test the spatial congruence of watersheds with the most historical and future hydrologic change; and (3) identify watersheds with high levels of hydrologic change under drier and wetter future climates. We assessed change for 5135 watersheds over a 60-year historical period and compared it to 90-year future projections. Watershed change was analyzed for climatic water deficit, April 1st snowpack, recharge, and runoff. Watersheds were ranked by change for the historical and two future scenarios. We developed a normalized index of hydrologic change that combined the four variables, and identified which watersheds show the most spatial congruence of large historical change and continued change under the two futures. Of the top 20{\%} of all watersheds (1028), 591 in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and Northwestern ecoregions have high spatial congruence across all time periods. Among watersheds where change accelerates in the future, but not historically, a majority are congruent between both climate models, predominantly in the Sierra Nevada, Cascade Ranges and the Northwestern ecoregions. This congruence of impacts in watersheds under drier or wetter scenarios is driven by snowpack, but in areas with low snowpack, hydrologic change varied spatially depending on projected precipitation and temperature, with 151 watersheds in Northwestern California showing high levels of drying under the drier scenario, while 103 watersheds in Central western and Southwestern California show increasing hydrologic activity under the wetter scenario. In some regions, the loss of snowpack allows the cycle of runoff and recharge to function without delay represented by springtime snow melt, causing these watersheds to become more immediately hydrologically responsive to changing climate. The study also found watersheds with low rainfall that have already passed through their highest response to changing climate, and show less future change. The methods used here can also be used to identify watersheds resilient to changing climate.},

modeling and storing field data: field data has to come from sampling the real surface and then interpolating.

Methods for storing field data 
1) digitized contours, 
2) mathematical functions, Mathematical function can interpolate (honoring all the control points) or approximate (not strictly honoring) the surface.
3) point systems, 
4) triangulated irregular networks (TINs), and 
5) digital elevation matrices (DEMs).

-Level of accuracy desired depends on subsequent use of interpolated data
-Interpolation requires autocorrelation

Interp approaches
1) Proximity polygons - simple approach. not continuous. useful for "nominal" data like soil type. 
2) Spatial avgs - what is "near"? within radius distance? X nearest neighbors?
3) Inverse distance weighting. Tests for coincidence. If prediction location is exactly coincident with an interp point, use that interp control point as the prediction. ALSO: cannot predict values lower than the minimum or higher than the maximum. ALSO: can raise the distance weight denominator to an exponent. higher values of k {\textgreater} bulls-eyes; values of k 
Which interp method is best? How tell?
- do they look reasonable
- hold back a subset and perform cross-validation
- leave one out cross-validation (for selecting k)

Even more options:
1) bicubic spline fitting: smoothest possible curves (in 2D) that can be fitted and still honor all the data.
2) multiquadric analysis. centers a varying-size circular cone on each of n control points. value of Z at any point is expressed as sum of quadratic cone surfaces.
3) TIN = basically distance-weighted interp

for grids, key slope calculation assumption: grid is dense enough for inclined plane assumption to be reasonable

abstract = {Models based on ecological processes (process-explicit models) are often used to predict ecosystem responses to environmental changes or management scenarios. However, models are imperfect and need to be validated, ideally by testing their assumptions and outputs against independent empirical data sets. Examples of validation of process-explicit models are rare. Recently, stochastic population models have been developed to predict the likely responses (over 10–120 years) of a riverine fish (golden perch, Macquaria ambigua) to flow management in the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB) in eastern Australia, one of the world's most regulated river basins. Declines in golden perch (and other species) are a direct consequence of altered hydrology, and managers require information to predict how fish will respond to possible future hydrological conditions to guide substantial investments in flow management. Here, we use two independent field data sets to validate our population model. We compared model predictions to observed trends to ask: (1) How do predicted population sizes and growth rates compare with observed data? (2) Does the correlation between predicted and observed population sizes and growth rates vary among populations? (3) Does the correlation between predicted and observed population sizes and growth rates vary across observed hydrological conditions? (4) How do modeled and observed fish movement rates compare? We found reasonable correlations between fish population sizes and growth rates as predicted by the model and observed in independent data sets for several populations (Aim 1), but the strength of these correlations varied among populations (Aim 2) and hydrological conditions (Aim 3). Predicted and observed fish movement rates were strongly correlated (Aim 4). Population models are frequently used in conservation decision-making but are rarely validated. We demonstrate that: (1) validation can identify model strengths and weaknesses; (2) observed data sets often have inherent limitations that can preclude robust validations; (3) validation is likely to be more common if appropriate observed data sets are available; and (4) validation should consider the purpose of modeling. Wider consideration of these messages would contribute to more critical examinations of models, so they can be most appropriately used in conservation decision-making.},

abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

abstract = {A new two-moment stratiform cloud microphysics scheme in a general circulation model is described. Prognostic variables include cloud droplet and cloud ice mass mixing ratios and number concentrations. The scheme treats several microphysical processes, including hydrometeor collection, condensation/ evaporation, freezing, melting, and sedimentation. The activation of droplets on aerosol is physically based and coupled to a subgrid vertical velocity. Unique aspects of the scheme, relative to existing two-moment schemes developed for general circulation models, are the diagnostic treatment of rain and snow number concentration and mixing ratio and the explicit treatment of subgrid cloud water variability for calculation of the microphysical process rates. Numerical aspects of the scheme are described in detail using idealized one-dimensional offline tests of the microphysics. Sensitivity of the scheme to time step, vertical resolution, and numerical method for diagnostic precipitation is investigated over a range of conditions. It is found that, in general, two substeps are required for numerical stability and reasonably small time truncation errors using a time step of 20 min; however, substepping is only required for the precipitation microphysical processes rather than the entire scheme. A new numerical approach for the diagnostic rain and snow produces reasonable results compared to a benchmark simulation, especially at low vertical resolution. Part II of this study details results of the scheme in single-column and global simulations, including comparison with observations.},

The role and relative importance ofCO2 in producing these climate changes remains unclear, however, in part because the ice-core deuterium record reflects local rather than global temperature. Here we construct a record of global surface temperature from 80 proxy records and show that temperature is correlated with and generally lags CO2 during the last (that is, the most recent) deglaciation. Differences between the respective temperature changes of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere parallel variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation recorded in marine sediments. These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2 concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age.},

abstract = {Streamflow is essential for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems and for supporting human water supply needs. Changes in climate, land use and water use practices may alter water availability. Understanding the potential effect of these changes on aquatic ecosystems is critical for long-term water management to maintain a balance between water for human consumption and ecosystem needs. Fish species data and streamflow estimates from a rainfall-runoff and flow routing model were used to develop boosted regression tree models to predict the relationship between streamflow and fish species richness (FSR) under plausible scenarios of (1) water withdrawal, (2) climate change and (3) increases in impervious surfaces in the Piedmont ecoregion of North Carolina, U.S.A. Maximum monthly flow, the fraction of total flow originating from impervious surface runoff, coefficient of monthly streamflow variability, and the specific river basin accounted for 50{\%} of the variability in FSR. This model was used to predict FSR values for all twelve-digit Hydrological Unit Code catchments (HUC-12s) in the North Carolina Piedmont under current flow conditions and under water withdrawal, climate change and impervious surface scenarios. Flow–ecology modeling results indicate that predicted FSR declined significantly with increased water withdrawals. However, the magnitude of decline varied geographically. A “hot-spot” analysis was conducted based on predicted changes in FSR under each scenario to understand which HUC-12s were most likely to be affected by changes in water withdrawals, climate and impervious surfaces. Under the 20{\%} withdrawal increase scenario, 413 of 886 (47{\%}) HUC-12s in the study area were predicted to lose one or more species. HUC-12s in the Broad, Catawba, Yadkin and Cape Fear river basins were most susceptible to species loss. These findings may help decision making efforts by identifying catchments most vulnerable to changing water availability. Additionally, FSR-discharge modeling results can assist resource agencies, water managers and stakeholders in assessing the effect of water withdrawals in catchments to better support the protection and long-term conservation of species.},

abstract = {Extinction risk is inversely associated with maximum per capita population growth rate (rmax). However, this parameter is not known for most threatened species, underscoring the value in identifying correlates of rmax that, in the absence of demographic data, would indirectly allow one to identify species and populations at elevated risk of extinction and their associated recovery potential. We undertook a comparative life-history analysis of 199 species from three taxonomic classes: Chondrichthyes (e.g., sharks; n ¼ 82), Actinopterygii (teleost or bony fishes; n ¼ 47), and Mammalia (n ¼ 70, including 16 marine species). Median rmax was highest for (and similar between) terrestrial mammals (0.71) and teleosts (0.43), significantly lower among chondrichthyans (0.26), and lower still in marine mammals (0.07). Age at maturity was the primary (and negative) correlate of rmax. In contrast, although body size was negatively correlated with rmax in chondrichthyans and mammals, evidence of an association in teleosts was equivocal, and fecundity was not related to rmax in fishes, despite recurring assertions to the contrary. Our analyses suggest that age at maturity can serve as a universal predictor of extinction risk in fishes and mammals when rmax itself is unknown. Moreover, in contrast to what is generally expected, the recovery potential of teleost fishes does not differ from that of terrestrial mammals. Our findings are supportive of the application of extinction-risk criteria that are based on generation time and that are independent of taxonomic affinity.},

May be more than one event at a given location

Point pattern analysis: points mapped on a plane. Study area objectively determined. Should include all relevant entities in the study region (not a sample). Event locations should be proper. 

Read through a "clean" problem before diving into messy real world data. Get a grounding in the assumptions first.

How do we describe a point pattern quantitatively? point density and point separation. Related to first- and second-order effects. First-order: absolute location is important (density-based descriptions); second-order: interaction/relative location is important. Usually impossible to distinguish these effects in practIce.

Centrography: mean center, standard distance; summary circle, standard distance ellipse

Density-based methods: overall density/intensity, quadrat counts (evenly spaced or randomly sampled). Variance-Mean Ratio. Should be 1.0 if distribution is Poisson one way to test for ISP/CSR)

Distance-based point pattern measures: nearest-neighbor; mean nearest-neighbor distance; G function: refined nearest-neighbor (cumulative frequency distribution of the nearest-neighbor distances); F-function ( cumulative frequency distribution for distances between random locations and events in set). K-functions on all the distances between events in S: compute average densities around ALL points at various radii (d); plot over d.

Then: How clustered? 5.3, assessing point patterns statistically.

"while hypothesis testing is possible for quadrat count data, it is not reliable unless we are dealing with very large point data sets with a high mean intensity of events per quadrat."

Distance testing: Clark and Evans' R statistic: E(d) = 1/2sqrt(lambda). d{\_}min / E(d) = R. If R 1, tendency to evenly spaced points. F and G curves are on the opposite sides of the expected value line. L function is a transformation that is used to compare the K(d) fuction to 0. 

Monte Carlo simulations used to generate expected values for, e.g., minimum distance, K(d), L(d). Advantages: no need for edge/area of study corrections; less sensitive to changing sample size; and spatial process models other than IRP can be investigated.

abstract = {Simulation-optimization methods are used to develop optimal solutions for a variety of groundwater management problems. The true optimality of these solutions is often dependent on the reliability of the simulation model. Therefore, where model predictions are uncertain due to parameter uncertainty, this should be accounted for within the optimization formulation to ensure that solutions are robust and reliable. In this study, we present a stochastic multi-objective formulation of the otherwise single objective groundwater optimization problem by considering minimization of prediction uncertainty as an additional objective. The proposed method is illustrated by applying to an injection bore field design problem. The primary objective of optimization is maximization of the total volume of water injected into a confined aquifer, subject to the constraints that the resulting increases in hydraulic head in a set of control bores are below specified target levels. Both bore locations and injection rates were considered as optimization variables. Prediction uncertainty is estimated using stacks of uncertain parameters and is explicitly minimized to produce robust and reliable solutions. Reliability analysis using post-optimization Monte Carlo analysis proved that while a stochastic single objective optimization failed to provide reliable solutions with a stack size of 50, the proposed method resulted in many robust solutions with high reliability close to 1.0. Results of the comparison indicate potential gains in efficiency of the stochastic multi-objective formulation to identify robust and reliable groundwater management strategies.},

We define systems analysis as that set of mathematical planning and design techniques which includes at least some formal optimization procedure. Based on the increasingly large number of systems-oriented papers which appear in the civil engineering literature, it is not unreasonable to expect that the use of one or another optimization technique would have been undertaken in a significant number of completed projects and described in the literature; this turns out not to be the case. Moreover, U.S. federal agencies and major consultants do not appear to use these techniques in any but a handful of projects. We offer several explanations for this, including institutional resistance to use of the techniques, deficiencies in data bases, inadequacies in modeling, and the fundamental insensitivity of many systems (not merely the models thereof) to wide variations in design choices. We explore the differences between application in developed and developing countries.},

Small ensembles are shown to be misleading in non-stationary conditions analogous to externally forced climate change, and sometimes also in stationary conditions which reflect the case of an unforced climate.

abstract = {A major reorganization of the North-east Pacific biota transpired following a climatic {\_}regime shift{\_} in the mid 1970s. In this paper, we characterize the effects of interdecadal climate forcing on the oceanic ecosystems of the NE Pacific Ocean. We consider the concept of scale in terms of both time and space within the North Pacific ecosystem and develop a conceptual model to illustrate how climate variability is linked to ecosystem change. Next we describe a number of recent studies relating climate to marine ecosystem dynamics in the NE Pacific Ocean. These studies have focused on most major components of marine ecosystems - primary and secondary producers, forage species, and several levels of predators. They have been undertaken at different time and space scales. However, taken together, they reveal a more coherent picture of how decadal-scale climate forcing may affect the large oceanic ecosystems of the NE Pacific. Finally, we synthesize the insight gained from interpreting these studies. Several general conclusions can be drawn. 1 There are large-scale, low-frequency, and sometimes very rapid changes in the distribution of atmospheric pressure over the North Pacific which are, in turn, reflected in ocean properties and circulation. 2 Oceanic ecosystems respond on similar time and space scales to variations in physical conditions. 3 Linkages between the atmosphere/ocean physics and biological responses are often different across time and space scales. 4 While the cases presented here demonstrate oceanic ecosystem response to climate forcing, they provide only hints of the mechanisms of interaction. 5 A model whereby ecosystem response to specified climate variation can be successfully predicted will be difficult to achieve because of scale mismatches and nonlinearities in the atmosphere-ocean-biosphere system.},

abstract = {More than a century of dam construction and water development in the western United States has led to extensive ecological alteration of rivers. Growing interest in improving river function is compelling practitioners to consider ecological restoration when managing dams and water extraction. We developed an Ecological Response Model (ERM) for the Cache la Poudre River, northern Colorado, USA, to illuminate effects of current and possible future water management and climate change. We used empirical data and modeled interactions among multiple ecosystem components to capture system-wide insights not possible with the unintegrated models commonly used in environmental assessments. The ERM results showed additional flow regime modification would further alter the structure and function of Poudre River aquatic and riparian ecosystems due to multiple and interacting stressors. Model predictions illustrated that specific peak flow magnitudes in spring and early summer are critical for substrate mobilization, dynamic channel morphology, and overbank flows, with strong subsequent effects on instream and riparian biota that varied seasonally and spatially, allowing exploration of nuanced management scenarios. Instream biological indicators benefitted from higher and more stable base flows and high peak flows, but stable base flows with low peak flows were only half as effective to increase indicators. Improving base flows while reducing peak flows, as currently proposed for the Cache la Poudre River, would further reduce ecosystem function. Modeling showed that even presently depleted annual flow volumes can achieve substantially different ecological outcomes in designed flow scenarios, while still supporting social demands. Model predictions demonstrated that implementing designed flows in a natural pattern, with attention to base and peak flows, may be needed to preserve or improve ecosystem function of the Poudre River. Improved regulatory policies would include preservation of ecosystem-level, flow-related processes and adaptive management when water development projects are considered.},

abstract = {Three statistical downscaling methods were applied to NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (used as a surrogate for the best possible general circulation model), and the down- scaled meteorology was used to drive a hydrologic model over California. The historic record was divided into an “observed” period of 1950–1976 to provide the basis for downscaling, and a “projected” period of 1977–1999 for assessing skill. The downscaling methods included a bias-correction/spatial downscaling method (BCSD), which relies solely on monthly large scale meteorology and resamples the historical record to obtain daily sequences, a constructed analogues approach (CA), which uses daily large-scale anomalies, and a hybrid method (BCCA) using a quantile-mapping bias correction on the large-scale data prior to the CA approach. At 11 sites we compared three simulated daily flow statistics: streamflow timing, 3-day peak flow, and 7-day low flow. While all downscaling methods produced reasonable streamflow statistics at most locations, the BCCA method consistently outperformed the other methods, capturing the daily large-scale skill and translating it to simulated streamflows that more skillfully reproduced observationally-driven streamflows},

abstract = {Mountain-block recharge (MBR) is the subsurface inflow of groundwater to lowland aquifers from adjacent mountains. MBR can be a major component of recharge but remains difficult to characterize and quantify due to limited hydrogeologic, climatic, and other data in the mountain block and at the mountain front. The number of MBR-related studies has increased dramatically in the 15 years since the last review of the topic was conducted by Wilson and Guan (2004), generating important advancements. We review this recent body of literature, summarize current understanding of factors controlling MBR, and provide recommendations for future research priorities. Prior to 2004, most MBR studies were performed in the southwestern United States. Since then, numerous studies have detected and quantified MBR in basins around the world, typically estimating MBR to be 5–50{\%} of basin-fill aquifer recharge. Theoretical studies using generic numerical modeling domains have revealed fundamental hydrogeologic and topographic controls on the amount of MBR and where it originates within the mountain block. Several mountain-focused hydrogeologic studies have confirmed the widespread existence of mountain bedrock aquifers hosting considerable groundwater flow and, in some cases, identified the occurrence of interbasin flow leaving headwater catchments in the subsurface—both of which are required for MBR to occur. Future MBR research should focus on the collection of high-priority data (e.g., subsurface data near the mountain front and within the mountain block) and the development of sophisticated coupled models calibrated to multiple data types to best constrain MBR and predict how it may change in response to climate warming.},

abstract = {Resource managers have traditionally had to rely on simple hydrological and habitat-association methods to predict how changes in river flow regimes will affect the viability of instream populations and communities. Yet these systems are characterized by dynamic feedbacks among system components, a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, and connectivity between habitats, none of which can be adequately captured in the commonly employed management methods. We argue that process-oriented ecological models, which consider dynamics across scales and levels of biological organization, are better suited to guide flow regime management. We review how ecological dynamics in streams and rivers are shaped by a combination of the flow regime and internal feedbacks, and proceed to describe ecological modeling tools that have the potential to characterize such dynamics. We conclude with a suggested research agenda to facilitate the inclusion of ecological dynamics into instream flow needs assessments. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Streams strongly influenced by groundwater discharge may serve as “climate refugia” for sensitive species in regions of increasingly marginal thermal conditions. The main goal of this study is to develop paired air and stream water annual temperature signal analysis techniques to elucidate the relative groundwater contribution to stream water and the effective groundwater flowpath depth. Groundwater discharge to streams attenuates surface water temperature signals, and this attenuation can be diagnostic of groundwater gaining systems. Additionally, discharge from shallow groundwater flowpaths can theoretically transfer lagged annual temperature signals from aquifer to stream water. Here we explore this concept using multi-year temperature records from 120 stream sites located across 18 mountain watersheds of Shenandoah National Park, VA, USA and a coastal watershed in Massachusetts, USA. Both areas constitute important cold-water habitat for native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Observed annual temperature signals indicate a dominance of shallow groundwater discharge to streams in the National Park, in contrast to the coastal watershed that has strong, apparently deeper, groundwater influence. The average phase lag from air to stream signals in Shenandoah National Park is 11 d; however, extended lags of approximately 1 month were observed in a subset of streams. In contrast, the coastal stream has pronounced attenuation of annual temperature signals without notable phase lag. To better understand these observed differences in signal characteristics, analytical and numerical models are used to quantify mixing of the annual temperature signals of surface and groundwater. Simulations using a total heat budget numerical model indicate groundwater-induced annual temperature signal phase lags are likely to show greater downstream propagation than the related signal amplitude attenuation. The measurement of multi-seasonal paired air and water temperatures offers great promise toward understanding catchment processes and informing current cold-water habitat management at ecologically-relevant scales.},

Since 1950, the cumulative number of publications about “freshwater or inland habitat and fisheries management” has been 60{\%}–95{\%} less than those considering “habitat and wildlife management.” The number of publications about “marine, river, and stream habitat and fisheries management” has also generally exceeded those for “lake habitat and fisheries management.” We provide a perspective comparing inland fish and wildlife habitat management systems and highlight lessons from wildlife ecology that could benefit inland fisheries. We reason that wildlife habitat management has become widespread and accepted because humans share habitats with wildlife and positive/negative responses to habitat restorations/loss are directly observable. We recommend that inland fisheries habitat studies and restorations include opportunities for humans to directly observe the ecological benefits of such practices. To support aquatic habitat management efforts, we suggest that dedicated funding solutions be considered to mitigate aquatic habitat loss. In theory, such a system would provide benefits to inland fish populations that parallel those provided to wildlife through state and federal stamps. Although aquatic habitat conservation and restoration may not solve management issues as rapidly, it will promote long-term sustainability and resiliency of diverse inland fish populations.},

Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

This second paper in the series investigates the processes responsible for this threshold response. We installed a dense spatial array of maximum rise crest stage gauges and recording wells on the hillslope and studied the temporal and spatial patterns of transient saturation at the soil-bedrock interface and its relation to subsurface stormflow measured at the trench face. Results show that while transient groundwater developed on parts of the hillslope during events smaller than 55 mm, it was not until more than 55 mm of rain fell before bedrock depressions on the hillslope were filled, water spilled over microtopographic relief in the bedrock surface, and the subsurface saturated areas became connected to the trench. When connectivity was achieved, the instantaneous subsurface stormflow rate increased more than fivefold compared to before the subsurface saturated areas were connected to the trench face. Total subsurface stormflow was more than 75 times larger when connectivity was achieved compared to when connectivity was not achieved. The fill and spill hypothesis presented in this paper is a process explanation for the observed threshold behavior of Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell (2006a), thereby linking patterns and processes.

Three existing bias correction methods, and a new one developed here, are applied to daily maximum temperature and precipitation from 21 GCMs to investigate how different methods alter the climate change signal of the GCM. The quantile mapping (QM) and cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) bias correction methods can significantly alter the GCM's mean climate change signal, with differences of up to 2°C and 30{\%} points for monthly mean temperature and precipitation, respectively. Equidistant quantile matching (EDCDFm) bias correction preserves GCM changes in mean daily maximum temperature but not precipitation. An extension to EDCDFm termed PresRat is introduced, which generally preserves the GCM changes in mean precipitation. Another problem is that GCMs can have difficulty simulating variance as a function of frequency. To address this, a frequency-dependent...},

abstract = {Complex, software-intensive, technically advanced, and computationally demanding models, presumably with ever-growing realism and fidelity, have been widely used to simulate and predict the dynamics of the Earth and environmental systems. The parameter-induced simulation crash (failure) problem is typical across most of these models despite considerable efforts that modellers have directed at model development and implementation over the last few decades. A simulation failure mainly occurs due to the violation of numerical stability conditions, non-robust numerical implementations, or errors in programming. However, the existing sampling-based analysis techniques such as global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods, which require running these models under many configurations of parameter values, are ill equipped to effectively deal with model failures. To tackle this problem, we propose a new approach that allows users to cope with failed designs (samples) when performing GSA without rerunning the entire experiment. This approach deems model crashes as missing data and uses strategies such as median substitution, single nearest-neighbor, or response surface modeling to fill in for model crashes. We test the proposed approach on a 10-parameter HBV-SASK (Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning modified by the second author for educational purposes) rainfall-runoff model and a 111-parameter Mod{\'{e}}lisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie (MESH) land surface-hydrology model. Our results show that response surface modeling is a superior strategy, out of the data-filling strategies tested, and can comply with the dimensionality of the model, sample size, and the ratio of the number of failures to the sample size. Further, we conduct a "failure analysis" and discuss some possible causes of the MESH model failure that can be used for future model improvement.},

abstract = {A method is presented for measuring the marginal welfare cost of environmental regulations affecting agriculture. The method incorporates output market effects and recognizes diversity in production conditions among crops, regions, and seasons. An important advantage of the method is that only regional outputs and changes in regional production costs are needed to calculate deadweight loss, thus simplifying the measurement of welfare changes. This feature of the model is significant since the complexity and substantial data requirements of most existing impact models cause many environmental regulations to be enacted with inadequate analysis of their economic impacts. The method also disaggregates welfare impacts by crop, place, and time, thus encouraging the implementation of nonuniform interventions that achieve a given level of environmental quality more efficiently than uniform policies.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a weather generator for use in climate impact assessments of agricultural and water system management. The generator produces internally consistent series of meteorological variables including: rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind, sunshine, as well as derivation of potential evapotranspiration. The system produces series at a daily time resolution, using two stochastic models in series: first, for rainfall which produces an output series which is then used for a second model generating the other variables dependent on rainfall. The series are intended for single sites defined nationally across the UK at a 5 km resolution, but can be generated to be representative across small catchments ({\textless}1000 km2). Scenarios can be generated for the control period (1961-1990) based on observed data, as well as for the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP02) scenarios for three time slices (2020s, 2050s and 2080s). Future scenarios are generated by fitting the models to observations which have been perturbed by application of change factors derived from the UKCIP02 mean projected changes in that variable. These change factors are readily updated, as new scenarios become available, and with suitable calibration data the approach could be extended to any geographical region. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In an effort to explain the source of nonstorm streamflow in deep-soiled areas of the southern Appalachians, a 3 3 45-foot inclining concrete trough was constructed on a 40 per cent slope. The structure was packed with a natural sandy-loam soil to a bulk density of 1.3, and after thorough soaking was covered with plastic to prevent evaporation. Outflow was measured at the base, and soil moisture tension and content were recorded for 145 days. As shown by piezometers, the larger pores were substantially emptied in 1.5 days, during which outflow occurred according to the expression, Q = a 1 T - b 1 where T is time in days since day zero and a 1 and b 1 are constants. After a 5-day transition period, the logarithm of drainage for the next 80 days was again linearly related to the logarithm of time, but with new constants,a 2 and b 2, expressing unsaturated flow from the entire soil mass. An additional 60 days of flow occurred, deviating more and more from the log-log relation as the limits of drainage were approached. Soil moisture content and tension substantiated the theory that the entire unsaturated soil mass was contributing to outflow throughout the experiment. It is concluded that unsaturated flow in the earth mantle of steep watersheds cannot be ignored in hydrograph analysis, since it may well be a primary mechanism for sustaining baseflow.},

abstract = {The two-layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC-2L) model is extended to incorporate a representation of subgrid variability in precipitation, using an analytical one- dimensional statistical dynamic representation for partial area coverage of precipitation. The analytical approach allows the effects of subgrid-scale spatial variability of precipitation on surface fluxes, runoff production, and soil moisture to be represented explicitly. With this method, spatially integrated representations of surface fluxes, runoff, and soil moisture due to subgrid-scale spatial variability in precipitation, infiltration, and vegetation cover are obtained. The results are compared with those obtained using an exhaustive pixel-based approach, and the results obtained by applying uniform precipitation over the precipitation- covered area. The precipitation coverage over a grid cell is shown to play a primary role in estimating the surface fluxes, runoff, and soil moisture. In general, the spatial distribution of precipitation within the precipitation-covered area plays a secondary role, in part because VIC-2L represents the subgrid spatial variability of soil properties. While the analytical approach gives good approximations to the pixel-based approach, and is superior to the uniform precipitation approach in general, the differences are not large. 1.},

abstract = {Background: Miscarriage occurs in 10{\%} to 15{\%} of pregnancies. The traditional treatment, after miscarriage, has been to perform surgery to remove any remaining placental tissues in the uterus ('evacuation of uterus'). However, medical treatments, or expectant care (no treatment), may also be effective, safe and acceptable. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of any medical treatment for incomplete miscarriage (before 24 weeks). Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2012) and reference lists of retrieved papers. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatment with expectant care or surgery or alternative methods of medical treatment. Quasi-randomised trials were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Data entry was checked. Main results: Twenty studies (4208 women) were included. There were no trials specifically of miscarriage treatment after 13 weeks' gestation. Three trials involving 335 women compared misoprostol treatment (all vaginally administered) with expectant care. There was no statistically significant difference in complete miscarriage (average risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 2.10; two studies, 150 women, random-effects), or in the need for surgical evacuation (average RR 0.62, 95{\%} CI 0.17 to 2.26; two studies, 308 women, random-effects). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. Twelve studies involving 2894 women addressed the comparison of misoprostol (six studies used oral administration, four studies used vaginal, one study sub-lingual, one study combined vaginal + oral) with surgical evacuation. There was a slightly lower incidence of complete miscarriage with misoprostol (average RR 0.97, 95{\%} CI 0.95 to 0.99, 11 studies, 2493 women, random-effects) but with success rate high for both methods. Overall, there were fewer surgical evacuations with misoprostol (average RR 0.06, 95{\%} CI 0.02 to 0.13; 11 studies, 2654 women, random-effects) but more unplanned procedures (average RR 5.82, 95{\%} CI 2.93 to 11.56; nine studies, 2274 women, random-effects). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. Nausea was more common with misoprostol (average RR 2.41, 95{\%} CI 1.44 to 4.03; nine studies, 2179 women, random-effects). Five trials compared different routes of administration and/or doses of misoprostol. There was no clear evidence of one regimen being superior to another. Limited evidence suggests that women generally seem satisfied with their care. Long-term follow-up from one included study identified no difference in subsequent fertility between the three approaches. Authors' conclusions: The available evidence suggests that medical treatment, with misoprostol, and expectant care are both acceptable alternatives to routine surgical evacuation given the availability of health service resources to support all three approaches. Women experiencing miscarriage at less than 13 weeks should be offered an informed choice. Future studies should include long-term follow-up.},

abstract = {River flows exert dominant controls on in-stream biota. Quantifying linkages between hydrology and biology is important for assessing the effects of flow alteration on ecological functions. Hydrologic models are often used to quantify these flow-ecology relationships and guide management actions. Traditional model calibration techniques typically focus on a best overall fit criterion that may not be suitable for environmental flow applications where certain elements of the flow regime exert a dominant influence on biotic composition. We present an approach for hydrologic model calibration that improves the accuracy of calculated flow metrics known to be significant drivers of ecosystem response. First, we developed regional flow-ecology relationships based on streamflow gage and benthic macroinvertebrate data from southern California to determine which streamflow metrics best explain variability in taxonomic and trait-based biotic indices. Next, we developed and calibrated a series of hydrologic models to minimize error in these important flow metrics. For our study sites, flow flashiness and low flow frequency (indicative of drying) were found to best explain biotic condition. Hydrologic models calibrated specifically to minimize errors in these flow metrics predicted macroinvertebrate indices better than models calibrated to maximize fit to the overall flow regime. This ecological-calibration approach requires some a priori knowledge of flow-ecology relationships, but it produces results that can improve assessment of the impacts of changing flow regimes on biota and guide the development of strategies to mitigate ecological degradation.},

Temperature measurements can be analyzed for recharge and discharge rates, the effects of surface warming, interchange with surface water, hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments, and basin-scale permeability. Temperature data are also used in formal solutions of the inverse problem to estimate ground water flow and hydraulic conductivity. The fundamentals of using heat as a ground water tracer were published in the 1960s, but recent work has significantly expanded the application to a variety of hydrogeological settings. In recent work, temperature is used to delineate flows in the hyporheic zone, estimate submarine ground water discharge and depth to the salt-water interface, and in parameter estimation with coupled ground water and heat-flow models. While short reviews of selected work on heat as a ground water tracer can be found in a number of research papers, there is no critical synthesis of the larger body of work found in the hydrogeological literature. The purpose of this review paper is to fill that void and to show that ground water temperature data and associated analytical tools are currently underused and have not yet realized their full potential.},

abstract = {Rivers and streams that do not flow permanently (herein intermittent rivers; IRs) make up a large proportion of the world's inland waters and are gaining widespread attention. We review the research on IRs from its early focus on natural history through to current application in management and policy. The few early studies of the ecology of IRs were largely descriptive. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, synthesis of this sparse research complemented work on temporary standing waters to found a powerful framework for much of the subsequent research on IRs. Research on the ecology and biogeochemistry of IRs continues to fuel our understanding of resistance and resilience to drying and flooding as disturbances. Syntheses of the growing literature, including cross-continental and cross-climate comparisons, are revealing the generality and individuality of ecological and ecosystem responses to flow cessation and surface water loss. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of experiments test the causality of these responses. Much of the increased consideration of IRs in research, management and policy is driven by the observed and projected shifts in flow regimes from perennial to intermittent associated with changes in land and water use and climate, superimposed on the high incidence of natural intermittency. The need to protect and better manage IRs is prompting researchers to develop new or modified methods to monitor flow status and assess the ecological condition of these systems. Intermittent river research and management will benefit from greater exploration of aquatic–terrestrial linkages, wet–dry cycling and temporal dynamics, more-detailed mapping and predictive modelling of flow intermittency and the application of metapopulation and metacommunity concepts alongside multiple-stressors and novel-ecosystems research. By building on existing knowledge, continuing to develop quantitative models and distribution maps and using experiments to test hypotheses and concepts, we can further ecological understanding and wise management of these ubiquitous ecosystems.},

abstract = {This study uses an instrumented (trenched) 0.5ha hillslope in the southern tier of New York State, USA, to provide new data and insights on how variable source areas and associated flow pathways form and combine to connect rainfall with downstream water flows across a hillslope. Measurements of water fluxes in the trench, upslope water table dynamics, surface and bedrock topography, and isotopic and geochemical tracers have been combined for a four-dimensional (space-time) characterization of subsurface storm flow responses. During events with dry antecedent conditions infiltrating rainwater was found to percolate through a prevailing fragipan layer to deeper soil layers, with much (33-71{\%}) of the total discharge of the hillslope originating from deeper water flow below the fragipan. During storm events with wet antecedent conditions and large rainfall amounts, shallow lateral flow of event and pre-event water above the fragipan occurred and was one magnitude greater than the deeper water flow contribution. Spatial surface and subsurface water quality observations indicate that water from a distance of up to 56m contributed runoff from the hillslope during storm events. In addition, mobilization of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) with subsurface flow played a greater role than with overland or near-surface flow. During all events TDP loads were highest in the total discharge during peak flows (8-11.5kgha -1d -1), except during the largest storm event, when TDP concentrations were highly diluted. These results have implications for strategies to protect streams and other downstream water recipients from waterborne nutrient and pollutant loading. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we review progress in conservation of freshwater biodiversity, with a focus on the period since 1986, and outline key challenges for the future. Driven by rising conservation concerns, freshwater ecologists have conducted a great deal of research over the past 25 y on the status, trends, autecology, and propagation of imperiled species, threats to these species, the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning, metapopulation dynamics, biodiversity hotspots, reserve design, habitat restoration, communication with stakeholders, and weaknesses of protective legislation. Nevertheless, existing efforts might be insufficient to stem the ongoing and coming multitude of freshwater extinctions. We briefly discuss 4 important challenges for freshwater conservation. First, climate change will imperil both freshwater species and human uses of fresh water, driving engineering responses that will further threaten the freshwater biota. We need to anticipate both ecological and human responses to climate change, and to encourage rational and deliberate planning of engineering responses to climate change before disasters strike. Second, because freshwater extinctions are already well underway, freshwater conservationists must be prepared to act now to prevent further losses, even if our knowledge is incomplete, and engage more effectively with other stakeholders. Third, we need to bridge the gap between freshwater ecology and conservation biology. Fourth, we suggest that scientific societies and scholarly journals concerned with limnology or freshwater sciences need to improve their historically poor record in publishing important papers and influencing practice in conservation ecology. Failure to meet these challenges will lead to the extinction or impoverishment of the very subjects of our research.},

abstract = {One of the most widely applied methodologies for developing instream flow recommendations is the instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM) and its component microhabitat model, physical habitat simulation (PHABSIM). In this paper we reviewed over 1,500 habitat-flow curves obtained from 127 PHABSIM studies from western North America to develop predictions for flow needs for salmonids in this region and to test whether habitat-flow relationships for salmonids were related to watershed characteristics and geographic location. We present regressions that predict PHABSIM optima for four life history stages of four salmonid species and for all salmonid species in the database as a group, and we quantify the uncertainty in these estimates. Mean annual discharge (MAD) was the best predictor of optimum flow. The general form of the regressions was loge(optimum flow) = A × loge(MAD), where A {\textless} 1. Minor improvement in predictive power was sometimes possible with addition of latitude and longitude coordinates to the regression. This relationship is asymptotic and differs considerably from the fixed flow percentages recommended by Tennant. Our results are presented as a planning tool to (1) allow managers and project proponents to conduct a preliminary assessment of proposed water-use development projects, (2) optimize research efforts for instream flow studies and experiments, and (3) set experimental boundaries for adaptive management of stream flow.},

abstract = {Setting instream flows to protect aquatic resources is required by California state law, but this task is not straightforward for an intermittent river that is naturally dry six or more months of every year. The Santa Maria River, 200km northwest of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, lies within the northern range of the federally endangered southern California steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and is a logical candidate for instream flow protection: the watershed historically supported the anadromous life history of this species, but fish must navigate the lowermost 39km of the commonly dry mainstem river to move between the ocean and freshwater habitats in the upper watershed. Mainstem flows are partly controlled by Twitchell Dam, constructed across one of the Santa Maria River's two main tributaries in 1962. The dam is operated to maximize groundwater recharge through the bed of the mainstem Santa Maria River, thus minimizing discharge to the Pacific Ocean and so reducing already limited steelhead passage opportunities. Conventional criteria for determining suitable instream flows for steelhead passage are ill-suited to intermittent, Mediterranean-type rivers because they ignore the dynamic channel morphology and critical importance of headwater flows in providing cues that once presaged passage-adequate mainstem discharges but no longer do so. Hydrologic analysis of pre-dam flows, coupled with established criteria for successful O. mykiss migration, provides an objective basis for evaluating alternative dam-management scenarios for enhancing steelhead passage, although their implementation would redirect some water that for the past half-century has exclusively supported irrigated agriculture and municipal water supplies. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The flow regime is a primary determinant of the structure and function of aquatic and riparian ecosystems for streams and rivers. Hydrologic alteration has impaired riverine ecosystems on a global scale, and the pace and intensity of human development greatly exceeds the ability of scientists to assess the effects on a river-by-river basis. Current scientific understanding of hydrologic controls on riverine ecosystems and experience gained from individual river studies support development of environmental flow standards at the regional scale. 2. This paper presents a consensus view from a group of international scientists on a new framework for assessing environmental flow needs for many streams and rivers simultaneously to foster development and implementation of environmental flow standards at the regional scale. This framework, the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration (ELOHA), is a synthesis of a number of existing hydrologic techniques and environmental flow methods that are currently being used to various degrees and that can support comprehensive regional flow management. The flexible approach allows scientists, water-resource managers and stakeholders to analyse and synthesise available scientific information into ecologically based and socially acceptable goals and standards for management of environmental flows. 3. The ELOHA framework includes the synthesis of existing hydrologic and ecological databases from many rivers within a user-defined region to develop scientifically defensible and empirically testable relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses. These relationships serve as the basis for the societally driven process of developing regional flow standards. This is to be achieved by first using hydrologic modelling to build a 'hydrologic foundation' of baseline and current hydrographs for stream and river segments throughout the region. Second, using a set of ecologically relevant flow variables, river segments within the region are classified into a few distinctive flow regime types that are expected to have different ecological characteristics. These river types can be further subclassified according to important geomorphic features that define hydraulic habitat features. Third, the deviation of current-condition flows from baseline-condition flow is determined. Fourth, flow alteration-ecological response relationships are developed for each river type, based on a combination of existing hydroecological literature, expert knowledge and field studies across gradients of hydrologic alteration. 4. Scientific uncertainty will exist in the flow alteration-ecological response relationships, in part because of the confounding of hydrologic alteration with other important environmental determinants of river ecosystem condition (e.g. temperature). Application of the ELOHA framework should therefore occur in a consensus context where stakeholders and decision-makers explicitly evaluate acceptable risk as a balance between the perceived value of the ecological goals, the economic costs involved and the scientific uncertainties in functional relationships between ecological responses and flow alteration. 5. The ELOHA framework also should proceed in an adaptive management context, where collection of monitoring data or targeted field sampling data allows for testing of the proposed flow alteration-ecological response relationships. This empirical validation process allows for a fine-tuning of environmental flow management targets. The ELOHA framework can be used both to guide basic research in hydroecology and to further implementation of more comprehensive environmental flow management of freshwater sustainability on a global scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

For global change issues, however, the set of potential states is often unknown, much less the probabilities, effect of actions or their net benefits.

abstract = {A method for calibrating models of agricultural production and resource use using nonlinear yield or cost functions is developed. The nonlinear parameters are shown to be implicit in the observed land allocation decisions at a regional or farm level. The method is implemented in three stages and initiated by a constrained linear program. The procedure automatically calibrates the model in terms of output, input use, objective function values and dual values on model constraints. The resulting nonlinear models show smooth responses to parameterization and satisfy the Hicksian conditions for competitive firms. This paper is a methodological paper for practi-tioners rather than theorists. Instead of a new method that requires additional data, I take a different perspective on mathematical program-ming using a more flexible specification than traditional linear constraints. Sometimes new methodologies are published, but not imple-mented. Positive mathematical programming (PMP) is a methodology that has been imple-mented but not published. Over the past eight years the PMP approach has been used on sev-eral policy models at the sectoral, regional and farm level. National sectoral models using PMP for the U.S., Canada, and Turkey include House; Ribaudo, Osborn, and Konyar; Horner et al.; and Kasnakoglu and Bauer. Regional models include Hatchett, Horner, and Howitt; Oamek and Johnson; and Quinby and Leuck. Rosen and Sexton apply PMP to individual farms. The PMP approach uses the farmer's crop allocation in the base year to generate self-calibrating models of agricultural production and resource use, consistent with microeco-nomic theory, that accomodate heterogeneous quality of land and livestock. Mathematical programming models are widely used for agricultural economic policy analysis, despite few methodological develop-ments in the past decade. Their popularity stems from several sources. First, they can be constructed from a minimal data set. In many cases, analysts are required to construct models for systems where time-series data are absent or are inapplicable due to structural changes in a developing or shifting economy. Second, the constraint structure inherent in programming models is well suited to characterizing re-source, environmental, or policy constraints. In some cases, a set of inequality constraints, such as those found in farm commodity programs, strongly influences crop and resource alloca-tion. Third, the Leontief production technology inherent in most programming models has an intrinsic appeal of input determinism when modeling farm production (Just, Zilberman, and Hochman). In addition, linear programming models are consistent with the Von Liebig pro-duction specification, which is preferable for several inputs (Paris and Knapp). While the PMP approach is unconventional in that it employs both programming con-straints and "positive" inferences from the base-year crop allocations, it has one strong at-traction for applied analysis: it works. That is to say, the PMP approach automatically cali-brates models using minimal data, and without using "flexibility" constraints. The resulting models are more flexible in their response to policy changes, and priors on yield variation or supply elasticities can be specified. With mod-ern algorithms and microcomputers, the result-ing quadratic programming problems can be readily solved. Following a brief overview of past ap-proaches to calibrating programming models of farm production and problems associated with these models, the equivalency of the Kuhn},

abstract = {Stream ecosystems provide multiple, valued services to society, including water supply, waste assimilation, recreation, and habitat for diverse and productive biological communities. Managers striving to sustain these services in the face of changing climate, land uses, and water demands need tools to assess the potential effectiveness of alternative management actions, and often, the resulting tradeoffs between competing objectives. Integrating predictive modeling with monitoring data in an adaptive management framework provides a process by which managers can reduce model uncertainties and thus improve the scientific bases for subsequent decisions. We demonstrate an integration of monitoring data with a dynamic, metapopulation model developed to assess effects of streamflow alteration on fish occupancy in a southeastern US stream system. Although not extensive (collected over three years at nine sites), the monitoring data allowed us to assess and update support for alternative population dynamic models using model probabilities and Bayes rule. We then use the updated model weights to estimate the effects of water withdrawal on stream fish communities and demonstrate how feedback in the form of monitoring data can be used to improve water resource decision making. We conclude that investment in more strategic monitoring, guided by a priori model predictions under alternative hypotheses and an adaptive sampling design, could substantially improve the information available to guide decision-making and management for ecosystem services from lotic systems.},

abstract = {Long-term planning for consumptive use (evapotranspiration) by crops is an important activity by the State of California. The information is needed to determine evapotranspiration of applied water (ETaw), which is equal to the seasonal cumulative evapotranspiration minus the initial soil water deficit and the total effective rainfall. This provides an estimate of the net water requirement to irrigate a crop. If the water requirement is divided by the weighted mean application efficiency, the result is a site-specific total irrigation water requirement to produce a crop. For many years, published crop coefficient (Kc) values were used to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from reference evapotranspiration (ETo); however, because the equations for ETo have changed, since the Kc values were developed, they are frequently in error. Also, the published K c values do not adequately account for the influence of rainfall frequency on early or late season ETc nor do they properly account for cover crops. In fact, it is difficult to find references as to how the published Kc values were determined. Based on newly published information on midseason Kc values and on bare soil evaporation, a user-friendly Excel computer program (CUP) was developed to improve long-term estimates and to account for rainfall, cover crop, and immaturity effects on Kc values and ETc. In this paper, the advantages of the new model over traditional long-term ETc estimates and errors in the old estimates will be discussed.},

The operation of the Three Gorges Dam decreased flooding days in the areas above 22-m elevation, resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation-covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern. As the timing of water level recession at elevations of 24–27 m were 12, 17, 19 and 16 days earlier than that in 1981–2002, the optimum elevation for Carex growth decreased from 25–26 m to 24–25 m.

abstract = {This paper is the outcome of a community initiative to identify major unsolved scientific problems in hydrology motivated by a need for stronger harmonisation of research efforts. The procedure involved a public consultation through online media, followed by two workshops through which a large number of potential science questions were collated, prioritised, and synthesised. In spite of the diversity of the participants (230 scientists in total), the process revealed much about community priorities and the state of our science: a preference for continuity in research questions rather than radical departures or redirections from past and current work. Questions remain focused on the process-based understanding of hydrological variability and causality at all space and time scales. Increased attention to environmental change drives a new emphasis on understanding how change propagates across interfaces within the hydrological system and across disciplinary boundaries.

abstract = {Recent studies predict that projected climate change will lead to significant reductions in summer streamflow in the mountainous regions of the Western US. Hydrologic modeling directed at quantifying these potential changes has focused on the magnitude and timing of spring snowmelt as the key control on the spatial-temporal pattern of summer streamflow. We illustrate how spatial differences in groundwater dynamics can also play a significant role in determining streamflow responses to warming. We examine two contrasting watersheds, one located in the Western Cascades and the other in the High Cascades mountains of Oregon. We use both empirical analysis of streamflow data and physically based, spatially distributed modeling to disentangle the relative importance of multiple and interacting controls. In particular, we explore the extent to which differences in snow accumulation and melt and drainage characteristics (deep ground water vs. shallow subsurface) mediate the effect of climate change. Results show that within the Cascade Range, local variations in bedrock geology and concomitant differences in volume and seasonal fluxes of subsurface water will likely result in significant spatial variability in responses to climate forcing. Specifically, watersheds dominated by High Cascade geology will show greater absolute reductions in summer streamflow with predicted temperature increases. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The decline and disappearance of species from large parts of their former geographical range has become an important issue in fisheries ecology. There is a need to identify which species are at risk of extinction. The available approaches have been subject to considerable debate - particularly when applied to commercially exploited species. Here we have compiled methods that have been used or may be used for assessing threat status of marine organisms. We organize the methods according to the availability of data on the natural history, ecology and population biology of species. There are three general approaches to inferring or assessing extinction risk: (i) correlative approaches based on knowledge of life histories and ecology; (ii) time-series approaches that examine changes in abundance; and (iii) demographic approaches based on age- or stage-based schedules of vital rates and fisheries reference points. Many methods are well suited to species that are highly catchable and/or have relatively low productivity, but theory is less well developed for assessing extinction risk in species exhibiting narrow geographical distributions or ecological specialization. There is considerable variation in both definitions of extinction risk and the precision and defensibility of the available risk assessment methods, so we suggest a two-tiered approach for defining and assessing extinction risk. First, simple methods requiring a few easily estimated parameters are used to triage or rapidly assess large numbers of populations and species to identify potentially vulnerable populations or species. Second, the populations and species identified as vulnerable by this process can then be subject to more detailed and rigorous population analysis explicitly considering sources of error and uncertainty.},

abstract = {The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years. Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long—28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

abstract = {Economically optimal operational changes and adaptations for California's water supply system are examined for a dry form of climate warming (GFDL CM2.1 A2) with year 2050 water demands and land use. Economically adaptive water management for this climate scenario is compared to a similar scenario with the historical climate. The effects of population growth and land use alone are developed for comparison. Compared with the historic hydrology, optimized operations for the dry climate warming scenario raise water scarcity and total operation costs by {\$}490 million/year with year 2050 demands. Actual costs might be somewhat higher where non-economic objectives prevail in water management. The paper examines the economical mix of adaptation, technologies, policies, and operational changes available to keep water supply impacts to such modest levels. Results from this screening model suggest promising alternatives and likely responses and impacts. Optimized operations of ground and surface water storage change significantly with climate. Dry-warm climate change increases the seasonal storage range of surface reservoirs and aquifers. Surface reservoir peak storage usually occurs about a month earlier under dry-warm climate change. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2007.},

abstract = {—Foraminiferal tests are a common component of many marine sediments. The oxygen iso- tope ratio ($\delta$18O) of test calcite is frequently used to reconstruct aspects of their life environment. The $\delta$18O depends mainly on the isotope ratio of the water it is precipitated from, the temperature of calcifica- tion, and, to a lesser extent, the carbonate ion concentration. Foraminifera and other organisms can poten- tially preserve their original isotope ratio for many millions of years, although diagenetic processes can alter the ratios. Work on oxygen isotope ratios of foraminifera was instrumental in the discovery of the orbital theory of the ice ages and continues to be widely used in the study of rapid climate change. Com- pilations of deep sea benthic foraminifer oxygen isotopes have revealed the long history of global climate change over the past 100 million years. Planktonic foraminifer oxygen isotopes are used to investigate the history of past sea surface temperatures, revealing the extent of past 'greenhouse' warming and global sea surface temperatures.},

abstract = {Life history variability includes phenotypic variation in morphology, age, and size at key stage transitions and arises from genotypic, environmental, and genotype-by-environment effects. Life history variation contributes to population abundance, productivity, and resilience, and management units often reflect life history classes. Recent evidence suggests that past Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) classifications (e.g., ‘stream' and ‘ocean' types) are not distinct evolutionary lineages, do not capture the phenotypic variation present within or among populations, and are poorly aligned with underlying ecological and developmental processes. Here we review recently reported variation in juvenile Chinook salmon life history traits and provide a refined conceptual framework for understanding the causes and consequences of the observed variability. The review reveals a broad continuum of individual juvenile life history pathways, defined primarily by transitions among developmental stages and habitat types used during freshwater rearing and emigration. Life history types emerge from discontinuities in expressed pathways when viewed at the population scale. We synthesize recent research that examines how genetic, conditional, and environmental mechanisms likely influence Chinook salmon life history pathways. We suggest that threshold models hold promise for understanding how genetic and environmental factors influence juvenile salmon life history transitions. Operational life history classifications will likely differ regionally, but should benefit from an expanded lexicon that captures the temporally variable, multi-stage life history pathways that occur in many Chinook salmon populations. An increased mechanistic awareness of life history diversity, and how it affects population fitness and resilience, should improve management, conservation, and restoration of this iconic species.},

abstract = {Climate strongly affects the production of sediment from moun- tain catchments as well as its transport and deposition within adjacent sedimentary basins . However, identifying climatic influences on basin stratigraphy is complicated by nonlinearities, feedback loops, lag times, buffering and convergence among pro- cesses within the sediment routeing system . The Palaeocene/ Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) arguably represents the most abrupt and dramatic instance of global warming in the Cenozoic era and has been proposed to be a geologic analogue for anthro- pogenic climate change. Here we evaluate the fluvial response in western Colorado to the PETM. Concomitant with the carbon isotope excursion marking the PETM we document a basin-wide shift to thick, multistoried, sheets of sandstone characterized by variable channel dimensions, dominance of upper flow regime sedimentary structures, and prevalent crevasse splay deposits. This progradation of coarse-grained lithofacies matches model predictions for rapid increases in sediment flux and discharge , instigated by regional vegetation overturn and enhanced mon- soon precipitation . Yet the change in fluvial deposition persisted long after the approximately 200,000-year-long PETM with its increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, emphasizing the strong role the protracted transmission ofcatchment responses to distant depositional systems has in constructing large-scale basin stratigraphy. Our results, combined with evidence for increased dissolved loads10 and terrestrial clay export to world oceans, indicate that the transient hyper-greenhouse climate of the PETM may represent a major geomorphic ‘system-clearing event'13 , involving a global mobilization of dissolved and solid sediment loads on Earth's surface.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of miscarriage among asymptomatic women after a prenatal visit between 6 and 11 weeks of gestation where proof of fetal viability of a singleton was obtained by office ultrasonography at the same visit. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study performed over 2 years (March 2004-2006) at an antenatal clinic at a large tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia. Those recruited were 697 asymptomatic women who attended their first antenatal visit between 6 (+2 days) and 11(+6 days) weeks of gestation, where evidence of fetal cardiac activity of a singleton was obtained by office ultrasonography. The main outcome measure was rates of miscarriage, stratified by gestation at presentation. RESULTS: One case was lost to follow-up. The risk of miscarriage among the entire cohort was 11 of 696 (1.6{\%}). The risk fell rapidly with advancing gestation; 9.4{\%} at 6 (completed) weeks of gestation, 4.2{\%} at 7 weeks, 1.5{\%} at 8 weeks, 0.5{\%} at 9 weeks and 0.7{\%} at 10 weeks ($\chi$; test for trend P=.001). Most who miscarried received their ultrasound diagnoses many weeks after their visit; five (45{\%}) were diagnosed in the second trimester, and all but one received their ultrasound diagnoses after 10 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSION: For women without symptoms, the risk of miscarriage after attending a first antenatal visit between 6 and 11 weeks is low (1.6{\%} or less), especially if they present at 8 weeks of gestation and beyond. Our data could be used to reassure such women that the probability of progressing to later than 20 weeks of gestation is very good. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.},

abstract = {Ecological limit functions relating streamflow and aquatic ecosystems remain elusive despite decades of research. We investigated functional relationships between species richness and changes in streamflow characteristics at 662 fish sampling sites in the Tennessee River basin. Our approach included the following: (1) a brief summary of relevant literature on functional relations between fish and streamflow, (2) the development of ecological limit functions that describe the strongest discernible relationships between fish species richness and streamflow characteristics, (3) the evaluation of proposed definitions of hydrologic reference conditions, and (4) an investigation of the internal structures of wedge-shaped distributions underlying ecological limit functions. Twenty-one ecological limit functions were developed across three ecoregions that relate the species richness of 11 fish groups and departures from hydrologic reference conditions using multivariate and quantile regression methods. Each negatively sloped function is described using up to four streamflow characteristics expressed in terms of cumulative departure from hydrologic reference conditions. Negative slopes indicate increased departure results in decreased species richness. Sites with the highest measured fish species richness generally had near-reference hydrologic conditions for a given ecoregion. Hydrology did not generally differ between sites with the highest and lowest fish species richness, indicating that other environmental factors likely limit species richness at sites with reference hydrology. Use of ecological limit functions to make decisions regarding proposed hydrologic regime changes, although commonly presented as a management tool, is not as straightforward or informative as often assumed. We contend that statistical evaluation of the internal wedge structure below limit functions may provide a probabilistic understanding of how aquatic ecology is influenced by altered hydrology and may serve as the basis for evaluating the potential effect of proposed hydrologic changes.},

The temperatures of the ambient air, stream water, streambed (depth = 10 cm), and adjacent stream sediment (depth = 10 cm) showed distinctive diurnal variations with long-term seasonal cooling trends, while groundwater temperature showed only a seasonal decreasing trend with little diurnal variations. Auto-correlations and spectral densities of the stream water, streambed, and sediment temperatures also revealed strong daily cyclical behaviors, with longer periodic cycles varying from weekly to monthly. Amplitudes and lag times of the streambed thermal signals were also affected by the hydraulic conductivities of the sediments. Lower hydraulic conductivity indicates a more attenuated and slower thermal response for the streambed. The calculated vertical water flow velocities of the streambed revealed that the investigated stream locations were under losing or gaining conditions, depending on the location and time.},

abstract = {Tradeoffs between human demands and ecological consequences of water resources necessitate setting limits to the hydrologic alteration of rivers – these limits or thresholds are required to prescribe environmental flows to maintain the ecological integrity of river ecosystems. Ideally, water managers could derive these thresholds empirically from hydroecological studies. Unfortunately, recent synthesis studies suggest that clear thresholds for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are elusive – if they exist at all. The field of ecological risk assessment (ERA) offers many approaches to describe and manage the prevalence and threat of an environmental stressor and establish limits of that stressor. This study introduces a hydroecological risk assessment (HERA) to identify thresholds of hydrologic alteration using an approach from ecological risk assessment and a stressor derived from publicly available hydrologic data. Rather than a single threshold value for ecological responses to hydrologic alteration, this study found that species exhibit variable patterns of response to depletion across their ranges – what we term Species Depletion Profiles (SDPs). These SDPs correlate with population health of the species in question, with similarities in conservation status and distribution evident among species with similar SDPs. Our results suggest that a well-used approach common to aquatic ecotoxicology has potential application in developing environmental flow guidelines for protection and remediation of riverine systems subject to anthropogenic influences where specific flow-ecology relationships are unknown.},

abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the importance of interpopulation diversity in fostering the stability of population complexes. Here we focus on California's recently collapsed fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and ask whether portfolio effect induced buffering is observed across the complexity hierarchy from individual populations to populations within a river basin (Sacramento, San Joaquin) to the entire Central Valley. Some buffering was observed when comparing the coefficient of variation in adult returns to a given river basin with its constituent populations but not when comparing returns to the entire Central Valley with its constituent basins because of disproportionately many fish returning to the Sacramento Basin. Moreover, we report that positive correlations in population dynamics between rivers were stronger in the last 25 years of the study compared with the first 25 years. Together, these results suggest evidence of only a weak portfolio effect that has deteriorated in recent years. Nonetheless, we also report that correlations between rivers decreased significantly with distance, suggesting that some biocomplexity remains. Our results suggest that the greatest potential for strengthening the portfolio effect would come through restoration of San Joaquin Basin populations, which at low abundance currently contribute little to the overall buffering capacity despite low cross-basin correlations.},

They vary by region and index, but are defined by runoff in the current water year compared to average historical runoff, with numerical thresholds categorizing year types. California's Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley Indices are used as case studies to examine how climate change affects indices. Modeled streamflow for 1951-2099 from the climate-forced Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model estimate potential changes in runoff and water year type frequency.

abstract = {Emerging diseases are impacting animals under high-density culture, yet few studies assess their importance to wild populations. Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import. We present four case studies that resolve microparasite impacts on adult salmon migration success, impact of river warming on microparasite replication, and infection status on susceptibility to predation. Future health of wild salmon must be considered in a holistic context that includes the cumulative or synergistic impacts of multiple stressors. These approaches will identify populations at greatest risk, critically needed to manage and potentially ameliorate the shifts in current or future trajectories of wild populations. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Environmental high flows are being implemented in many flow-regulated rivers globally. The questions arise as to whether different rivers respond similarly to artificial floods, and what are the long-term ecological consequences of such flood programs? This study evaluated abiotic/biotic dynamics during experimental floods in two rivers with contrasting valley morphologies (canyon-confined vs open-valley) as well as long-term response patterns of macroinvertebrates in both rivers to 16 years of experimental floods. Both systems showed an increase in measured parameters (turbidity, total phosphorus, drift, seston) during the rising limb of the flood with subsequent decreases being observed before the falling limb of the flood (all parameters displayed typical hysteresis patterns with discharge). Contrasting differences existed in respect to immediate effects of these two floods on macroinvertebrates and benthic periphyton (decreases or no change). Over the long term, major channel changes occurred from initial floods with less change observed from later floods in both systems. Macroinvertebrate densities fluctuated seasonally, but showed no long-term response to the flood program, whereas taxa richness increased in both systems. The rivers differed in macroinvertebrate community structure and this was reflected in shifts in community assembly over the study period in both systems (being substantially greater in the system flowing through a confined valley). The results suggest that immediate flood effects are quite similar among rivers, even over multiple years, but long-term trajectories in community assembly reflect changes in local habitat conditions in respect to external drivers such as landscape geomorphology.},

abstract = {Hyporheic exchange is an important process that underpins stream ecosystem function, and there have been numerous ways to characterize and quantify exchange flow rates and hyporheic zone size. The most common approach, using conservative stream tracer experiments and 1-D solute transport modeling, results in oversimplified representations of the system. Here we present a new approach to quantify hyporheic exchange and the size of the hyporheic zone (HZ) using high-resolution temperature measurements and a coupled 1-D transient storage and energy balance model to simulate in-stream water temperatures. Distributed temperature sensing was used to observe in-stream water temperatures with a spatial and temporal resolution of 2 and 3 min, respectively. The hyporheic exchange coefficient (which describes the rate of exchange) and the volume of the HZ were determined to range between 0 and 2.7 × 10 -3 s -1 and 0 and 0.032 m 3 m -1, respectively, at a spatial resolution of 1-10 m, by simulating a time series of in-stream water temperatures along a 565 m long stretch of a small first-order stream in central Luxembourg. As opposed to conventional stream tracer tests, two advantages of this approach are that exchange parameters can be determined for any stream segment over which data have been collected and that the depth of the HZ can be estimated as well. Although the presented method was tested on a small stream, it has potential for any stream where rapid (in regard to time) temperature change of a few degrees can be obtained. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {We examined flow alteration-ecology relationships in benthic macroinvertebrate, fish, and crayfish assemblages in Ozark Highland streams, USA, over two years with contrasting environmental conditions, a drought year (2012) and a flood year (2013). We hypothesized that: 1) there would be temporal variation in flow alteration-ecology relationships between the two years, 2) flow alteration-ecology relationships would be stronger during the drought year vs the flood year, and 3) fish assemblages would show the strongest relationships with flow alteration. We used a quantitative richest-targeted habitat (RTH) method and a qualitative multi-habitat (QMH) method to collect macroinvertebrates at 16 USGS gaged sites during both years. We used backpack electrofishing to sample fish and crayfish at 17 sites in 2012 and 11 sites in 2013. We used redundancy analysis to relate biological response metrics, including richness, diversity, density, and community-based metrics, to flow alteration. We found temporal variation in flow alteration-ecology relationships for all taxa, and that relationships differed greatly between assemblages. We found relationships were stronger for macroinvertebrates during the drought year but not for other assemblages, and that fish assemblage relationships were not stronger than the invertebrate taxa. Magnitude of average flow, frequency of high flow, magnitude of high flow, and duration of high flow were the most important categories of flow alteration metrics across taxa. Alteration of high and average flows was more important than alteration of low flows. Of 32 important flow alteration metrics across years and assemblages, 19 were significantly altered relative to expected values. Ecological responses differed substantially between drought and flood years, and this is likely to be exacerbated with predicted climate change scenarios. Differences in flow alteration-ecology relationships among taxonomic groups and temporal variation in relationships illustrate that a complex suite of variables should be considered for effective conservation of stream communities related to flow alteration.},

abstract = {Recent studies have documented the important role that ‘‘atmospheric rivers'' (ARs) of concentrated near-surface water vapor above the Pacific Ocean play in the storms and floods in California, Oregon, and Washington. By delivering large masses of warm, moist air (sometimes directly from the Tropics), ARs establish conditions for the kinds of high snowlines and copious orographic rainfall that have caused the largest historical storms. In many California rivers, essentially all major historical floods have been associated with AR storms. As an example of the kinds of storm changes that may influence future flood frequencies, the occurrence of such storms in historical observations and in a 7-model ensemble of historical-climate and projected future climate simulations is evaluated. Under an A2 greenhouse-gas emissions scenario (with emissions accelerating throughout the 21st Century), average AR statistics do not change much in most climate models; however, extremes change notably. Years with many AR episodes increase, ARs with higher-than-historical water-vapor transport rates increase, and AR storm-temperatures increase. Furthermore, the peak season within which most ARs occur is commonly projected to lengthen, extending the flood-hazard season. All of these tendencies could increase opportunities for both more frequent and more severe floods in California under projected climate changes.},

The results indicated that the MVP size ranged from 42 to 320 individuals, and instantaneous per-capita population growth rate ranged from 0.009 to 0.188 per year. MVP size and population growth rate were significantly associated with three life history traits: the age at maturity, generation time, and fecundity.

The opportunity for MAR in farming landscapes has received less attention, and the extent this might occur using water from large flood events or dam releases has not been examined. This paper addresses that gap by providing an overview of the potential benefits and challenges to implementing MAR using water from large floods, examining the social acceptability of MAR amongst groundwater licence holders in the Namoi Valley, and identifying future research needed to assess this opportunity. The appeal of MAR using water from large flood events is the opportunity it affords to replenish aquifers, return linkages between depleted groundwater and surface flows, and buffer the impacts of drought on irrigators and aquatic ecosystems. Most of the respondents to the Namoi survey agreed that MAR has merit. However, some research informants were concerned about the impact of recharge on groundwater quality and the possibility that MAR would be another intervention that would lead to over-exploitation of a scarce resource. A number of ways to implement MAR using large flood events are also canvassed and we identify next steps for the assessment of those options. {\textcopyright} 2013 Environment Institute of Australia and New Zealand Inc.},

We define systems analysis as that set of mathematical planning and design techniques which includes at least some formal optimization procedure. Based on the increasingly large number of systems-oriented papers which appear in the civil engineering literature, it is not unreasonable to expect that the use of one or another optimization technique would have been undertaken in a significant number of completed projects and described in the literature; this turns out not to be the case. Moreover, U.S. federal agencies and major consultants do not appear to use these techniques in any but a handful of projects. We offer several explanations for this, including institutional resistance to use of the techniques, deficiencies in data bases, inadequacies in modeling, and the fundamental insensitivity of many systems (not merely the models thereof) to wide variations in design choices.

abstract = {Due to increasing water demands globally, freshwater ecosystems are under constant pressure. Groundwater resources, as the main source of accessible freshwater, are crucially important for irrigation worldwide. Over-abstraction of groundwater leads to declines in groundwater levels; consequently, the groundwater inflow to streams decreases. The reduction in baseflow and alteration of the streamflow regime can potentially have an adverse effect on groundwater-dependent ecosystems. A spatially distributed, coupled groundwater–surface water model can simulate the impacts of groundwater abstraction on aquatic ecosystems. A constrained optimization algorithm and a simulation model in combination can provide an objective tool for the water practitioner to evaluate the interplay between economic benefits of groundwater abstractions and requirements to environmental flow. In this study, a holistic catchment-scale groundwater abstraction optimization framework has been developed that allows for a spatially explicit optimization of groundwater abstraction, while fulfilling a predefined maximum allowed reduction of streamflow (baseflow [Q95] or median flow [Q50]) as constraint criteria for 1484 stream locations across the catchment. A balanced K-Means clustering method was implemented to reduce the computational burden of the optimization. The model parameters and observation uncertainties calculated based on Bayesian linear theory allow for a risk assessment on the optimized groundwater abstraction values. The results from different optimization scenarios indicated that using the linear programming optimization algorithm in conjunction with integrated models provides valuable information for guiding the water practitioners in designing an effective groundwater abstraction plan with the consideration of environmental flow criteria important for the ecological status of the entire system.},

abstract = {Simple hydraulic models for outflow of groundwater into a stream suggest that the form of the storage-discharge relationship for groundwater changes from linear, for a confined aquifer, to quadratic, for an unconfined flow. Tests of the form of stream flow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage-discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage-discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to 'leaky' catchments, where the recession reaches zero flow, has been tested on two data sets. The second part of the paper deals with algorithms for baseflow during surface runoff events - the problem of hydrograph separation. Algorithms with one, two and three parameters have been compared, using data for the same 11 streams, and the results show significant differences in the baseflow index (BFI) predicted for some catchments. The two-parameter algorithm, which is fitted subjectively, is more consistent in providing plausible results than either the one- or three-parameter algorithms, both of which can be fitted objectively.},

abstract = {In recognition of the influence of flow on riverine habitats and organisms, stream ecologists have devoted considerable effort to the development of quantitative predictive relationships describing ecological responses to flow variability, i.e. flow-ecology relationships. Methods used to generate flow-ecology relationships can be thought of as a continuum bookended by pure states approaches on one end and by rates approaches on the other. In pure states approaches, the ecological response is a snapshot of a condition or property (i.e. a state) derived from a single measurement in time. In contrast, ecological responses in rates approaches reflect temporal change (i.e. a rate) and are thus reliant on repeated measurements made over time. Here, we elaborate on the fundamental characteristics of different approaches (pure states, rates and an intermediate approach we call repeated states) for generating flow-ecology relationships, examine how commonly the different approaches are used in the flow-ecology literature, conduct an independent analysis to illustrate the different outcomes achieved by applying repeated-states and rates approaches using a dataset for stream fish diversity in relation to flow magnitude, and identify some of the different ways ecologists are applying rates approaches in flow ecology. Our literature review revealed that repeated-states approaches (53{\%} of reviewed studies) were used far more commonly than either pure states (19{\%}) or rates (12{\%}) approaches to generate flow-ecology relationships. The remaining hybrid studies (17{\%}) used both state and rate responses, and thus also relied on repeated measurements over time. Despite frequent collection of data suitable for rates approaches, flow-ecology relationships have generally been developed using states approaches that relate changes in ecological states to different long-term average flow conditions, rather than to specific flow sequences over much shorter time intervals. Such flow-ecology relationships cannot generate temporally specific predictions of ecological responses to changing flow conditions (i.e. the expected change in state following a specific flow sequence), nor can they describe demographic processes underlying observed changes. While there are different scenarios in which a pure or repeated-states approach would be useful, more frequent use of rates approaches would increase our ability to test flow-ecology hypotheses and our mechanistic understanding of flow-ecology relationships.},

abstract = {California is currently in the midst of a record-setting drought. The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. Analyzing historical climate observations from California, we find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create ∼100{\%} probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm-dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the "exceptional" 2012-2014 drought in California.},

abstract = {Relationships between river flow characteristics and fish community/population dynamics (i.e. flow-ecology relationships) underpin methods to determine and monitor environmental water allocations. Quantifying these relationships can be difficult, and consequently, most environmental flow strategies for fish conservation in Australian rivers are based on general flow-ecology relationships as opposed to statistical predictions. Of those studies that have investigated relationships between flow and fish, most have not accounted for incomplete and variable detection of fish by the sampling methods, thus making the implicit assumption that sampling efficiency is invariant. This important assumption is rarely met, leading to inconsistent research findings and spurious results, and a reliance on generic flow-ecology principles for defining flow management strategies. We illustrate how and when detection probability varies when sampling freshwater fish and the consequences to scientific inference about fish-flow relationships. Methods for accounting for imperfect detection of fish are identified and tools to increase the efficiency of experimental designs while reducing sampling cost are discussed. These tools include methods for borrowing information among experimental components and simulation techniques to optimise sampling designs. We argue that, due to the very nature of sampling designs to quantify flow-ecology relationships (e.g. sampling at different flow magnitudes/regimes), the challenge of imperfect detectability is particularly relevant to environmental flow science. We encourage the broader adoption of methods that account for imperfect detection to improve inference about fish-flow relationships and increase the successful application of environmental flows for managing fish communities.},

For the 2020/21 – 2059/2060 period, there is no projected increase in the frequency of extremely dry wet seasons in the ensemble-mean. Wet extremes are found to increase to around 1.5 to 2 times the historical frequency, though this is not statistically significant at the 5{\%} level.

Across all models, extremely dry wet seasons are roughly 1.5 to 2 times more common, and wet extremes generally triple in their historical frequency.

abstract = {Juvenile coho salmon thrive in intermittent streams of the Pacific Northwest yet are in danger of increased mortality from drought and rising temperatures. With warmer temperatures and more frequent climate extremes projected, the need to understand how intermittent stream hydrology and biogeochemistry impact juvenile salmonid habitat and behavior is imperative. Previous investigations indicated that dissolved oxygen limits the persistence of coho salmon in intermittent streams, leading to the hypothesis that groundwater inflow would ultimately control patterns of salmon recruitment and persistence. Here we tested that hypothesis in paired tributaries of Salmon Creek, Sonoma County, CA during California's extreme drought of 2011–2017. We used the fluorescent fingerprint of dissolved organic carbon, together with a parallel factor analysis, to estimate groundwater influence in individual stream pools, corroborating those estimates with stable isotope and radon analyses. Repeat snorkel surveys provided fish counts in those pools at the beginning and end of the period of surface-water disconnection. Results suggested that coho salmon fry preferentially selected pools with a groundwater inflow signal and persisted in pools maintaining that signal through the dry season. This groundwater inflow signal was distinct from hyporheic influence, which exhibited little correlation with fish distribution. Groundwater within pools was young, and spot measurements suggested that it was relatively oxygenated. Proportional groundwater contributions to pools increased as drought deepened. Results suggest that maintaining relatively high groundwater levels in coastal aquifers may be imperative to the persistence of vulnerable salmonid populations in a changing climate.},

abstract = {The Scott and Shasta rivers, Klamath River tributaries, experience spatial disparity in habitat quality in spring and summer as a result of historical and current land- use. Juvenile Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) born in the upper tributary reaches often rear in natal streams before migrating to sea. However, those born in the lower reaches often encounter unsuitable habitat and emigrate during their first spring to seek non-natal rearing habitats. It is assumed that these early outmigrants are population losses. This study evaluated first-summer survival, and contribution to the adult population, of non-natal rearing juveniles in the Klamath River Basin. In the spring of 2014 and 2015 juveniles were tagged using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags as they were leaving the lower Scott and Shasta Rivers. Movement and survival was subsequently tracked using recapture and detection efforts in potential mainstem summer rearing locations. Strontium microchemistry from otolith samples of returning adult Coho Salmon throughout the basin was analyzed to estimate the contribution of non-natal rearing juveniles to adult returns. Few tagged individuals were detected in non-natal rearing habitats, but those detected in these habitats had survival rates comparable to natal-rearing individuals. Otolith analysis indicated that the proportion of juvenile Coho Salmon rearing in non-natal habitats varied by spawning site. In total, 53{\%} of the 116 adults sampled reared in a natal location as juveniles, while 47{\%} reared in a non-natal location. These results suggest that non-natal rearing can contribute to adult returns and could be a significant population segment with increased restoration.},

It is well known that California experiences dramatic swings in precipitation that are difficult to predict and challenging to agriculture. In times of drought, groundwater serves as a crucial savings account that is heavily relied upon. However, few tools exist to proactively refill this crucial reserve in wet years. We explored the idea of intentional winter flooding of agricultural land to promote on-farm recharge of the underlying groundwater. Field experiments were conducted on two established alfalfa stands to determine the feasibility of groundwater recharge and test realistic water application amounts and timings and potential crop damage. We studied soils with relatively high percolation rates and found that most of the applied water percolated to the groundwater table, resulting in short-lived saturated conditions in the root zone and minimal yield loss. While caution is appropriate to prevent crop injury, winter recharge in alfalfa fields with highly permeable soils appears to be a viable practice.},

A number of recent studies aim to identify policies mapping future observations to actions—in other words, framing climate adaptation as an optimal control problem. This paper uses the control paradigm to review and classify recent dynamic planning studies according to their approaches to uncertainty characterization, policy structure, and solution methods. We propose a set of research gaps and opportunities in this area centered on the challenge of characterizing uncertainty, which prevents the unambiguous application of control methods to this problem. These include exogenous uncertainty in forcing, model structure, and parameters propagated through a chain of climate and hydrologic models; endogenous uncertainty in human-environmental system dynamics across multiple scales; and sampling uncertainty due to the finite length of historical observations and future projections. Recognizing these challenges, several opportunities exist to improve the use of control methods for climate adaptation, namely, how problem context and understanding of climate processes might assist with uncertainty quantification and experimental design, out-of-sample validation and robustness of optimized adaptation policies, and monitoring and data assimilation, including trend detection, Bayesian inference, and indicator variable selection. We conclude with a summary of recommendations for dynamic water resources planning under climate change through the lens of optimal control.},

abstract = {This study contributes a rigorous diagnostic assessment of state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and highlights key advances that the water resources field can exploit to better discover the critical tradeoffs constraining our systems. This study provides the most comprehensive diagnostic assessment of MOEAs for water resources to date, exploiting more than 100,000 MOEA runs and trillions of design evaluations. The diagnostic assessment measures the effectiveness, efficiency, reliability, and controllability of ten benchmark MOEAs for a representative suite of water resources applications addressing rainfall-runoff calibration, long-term groundwater monitoring (LTM), and risk-based water supply portfolio planning. The suite of problems encompasses a range of challenging problem properties including (1) many-objective formulations with four or more objectives, (2) multi-modality (or false optima), (3) nonlinearity, (4) discreteness, (5) severe constraints, (6) stochastic objectives, and (7) non-separability (also called epistasis). The applications are representative of the dominant problem classes that have shaped the history of MOEAs in water resources and that will be dominant foci in the future. Recommendations are given for the new algorithms that should serve as the benchmarks for innovations in the water resources literature. The future of MOEAs in water resources needs to emphasize self-adaptive search, new technologies for visualizing tradeoffs, and the next generation of computing technologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Knowledge about population responses to environmental variability, including extreme climatic events, is crucial for understanding their current status and likely fate under future environmental change. The frequency and intensity of extreme events is projected to increase, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Anadromous fishes depend on freshwater habitats for spawning and juvenile rearing, making them sensitive to altered hydrologic regimes. Here, we evaluate the effect of past and projected variability in river hydrology on freshwater production of naturally spawning coho salmon populations from coastal river systems in Washington, USA. Using a stage-based life-cycle model, we show that juvenile production during freshwater residence depends on river flow characteristics. Most importantly, juvenile production is reduced by low minimum stream flows during summer. Based on climate model projections suggesting more extreme summer droughts in the region, we then simulate changes in river flow characteristics and quantify the effects of more frequent and severe low flows during summer on juvenile production as well as the harvest that can be sustained in these populations. Our results demonstrate that changes in hydrologic regimes due to environmental change, especially extreme low flows during summer, may significantly affect juvenile production in anadromous fishes such as coho salmon and the services these populations provide to their ecosystems and humans. Understanding population responses to extreme climatic events is thus essential for improving species conservation and risk assessments.},

abstract = {In an effort to develop quantitative relationships between various kinds of flow alteration and ecological responses, we reviewed 165 papers published over the last four decades, with a focus on more recent papers. Our aim was to determine if general relationships could be drawn from disparate case studies in the literature that might inform environmental flows science and management. For all 165 papers we characterised flow alteration in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change as reported by the individual studies. Ecological responses were characterised according to taxonomic identity (macroinvertebrates, fish, riparian vegetation) and type of response (abundance, diversity, demographic parameters). A 'qualitative' or narrative of the reported results strongly corroborated previous, less comprehensive, reviews by documenting strong and variable ecological responses to all types of flow alteration. Of the 165 papers, 152 (92{\%}) reported decreased values for recorded ecological metrics in response to a variety of types of flow alteration, whereas 21 papers (13{\%}) reported increased values. Fifty-five papers had information suitable for quantitative analysis of ecological response to flow alteration. Seventy per cent of these papers reported on alteration in flow magnitude, yielding a total of 65 data points suitable for analysis. The quantitative analysis provided some insight into the relative sensitivities of different ecological groups to alteration in flow magnitudes, but robust statistical relationships were not supported. Macroinvertebrates showed mixed responses to changes in flow magnitude, with abundance and diversity both increasing and decreasing in response to elevated flows and to reduced flows. Fish abundance, diversity and demographic rates consistently declined in response to both elevated and reduced flow magnitude. Riparian vegetation metrics both increased and decreased in response to reduced peak flows, with increases reflecting mostly enhanced non-woody vegetative cover or encroachment into the stream channel. Our analyses do not support the use of the existing global literature to develop general, transferable quantitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological response; however, they do support the inference that flow alteration is associated with ecological change and that the risk of ecological change increases with increasing magnitude of flow alteration. New sampling programs and analyses that target sites across well-defined gradients of flow alteration are needed to quantify ecological response and develop robust and general flow alteration-ecological response relationships. Similarly, the collection of pre- and post-alteration data for new water development programs would significantly add to our basic understanding of ecological responses to flow alteration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The available meteorological data include temperature, precipitation, and wind, as well as derived humidity and downwelling solar and infrared radiation estimated via algorithms that index these quantities to the dailymean temperature, temperature range, and precipitation, and disaggregate themto 3-hourly time steps. Furthermore, the authors employ the variable infiltration capacity (VIC)model to produce 3-hourly estimates of soilmoisture, snow water equivalent, discharge, and surface heat fluxes. Relative to an earlier similar dataset byMaurer and others, the improved dataset has 1) extended the period of analysis (1915–2011 versus 1950–2000), 2) increased the spatial resolution from 1 / 88 to 1 168, and 3) used an updated version of VIC. The previous dataset has been / widely used in water and energy budget studies, climate change assessments, drought reconstructions, and for many other purposes.

abstract = {Human impacts on the world's oceans have been substantial, leading to concerns about the extinction of marine taxa. We have compiled 133 local, regional and global extinctions of marine populations. There is typically a 53-year lag between the last sighting of an organism and the reported date of the extinction at whatever scale this has occurred. Most disappearances (80{\%}) were detected using indirect historical comparative methods, which suggests that marine extinctions may have been underestimated because of low-detection power. Exploitation caused most marine losses at various scales (55{\%}), followed closely by habitat loss (37{\%}), while the remainder were linked to invasive species, climate change, pollution and disease. Several perceptions concerning the vulnerability of marine organisms appear to be too general and insufficiently conservative. Marine species cannot be considered less vulnerable on the basis of biological attributes such as high fecundity or large-scale dispersal characteristics. For commercially exploited species, it is often argued that economic extinction of exploited populations will occur before biological extinction, but this is not the case for non-target species caught in multispecies fisheries or species with high commercial value, especially if this value increases as species become rare. The perceived high potential for recovery, high variability and low extinction vulnerability of fish populations have been invoked to avoid listing commercial species of fishes under international threat criteria. However, we need to learn more about recovery, which may be hampered by negative population growth at small population sizes (Allee effect or depensation) or ecosystem shifts, as well as about spatial dynamics and connectivity of subpopulations before we can truly understand the nature of responses to severe depletions. The evidence suggests that fish populations do not fluctuate more than those of mammals, birds and butterflies, and that fishes may exhibit vulnerability similar to mammals, birds and butterflies. There is an urgent need for improved methods of detecting marine extinctions at various spatial scales, and for predicting the vulnerability of species.},

abstract = {The science and practice of environmental flows have advanced significantly over the last several decades. Most environmental flow approaches require quantifying the relationships between hydrologic change and biologic response, but this can be challenging to determine and implement due to high data requirements, limited transferability, and the abundance of hydrologic metrics available for evaluation. We suggest that a functional flows approach, focusing on elements of the natural flow regime known to sustain important ecosystem processes, offers a pathway for linking understanding of ecosystem processes with discrete, quantifiable measures of the flow regime for a broad range of native taxa and assemblages. Functional flow components can be identified as distinct aspects of the annual hydrograph that support key biophysical processes, such as wet season flood flows or spring recession flows, and then quantified by flow metrics, such as 5{\%} exceedance flow or daily percent decrease in flow, respectively. By selecting a discrete set of flow metrics that measure key functional flow components, the spatial and temporal complexity of flow regimes can be managed in a holistic manner supportive of multiple ecological processes and native aquatic species requirements. We provide an overview of the functional flows approach to selecting a defined set of flow metrics and illustrate its application in two seasonally variable stream systems. We further discuss how a functional flows approach can be utilized as a conceptual model both within and outside of existing environmental flow frameworks to guide consideration of ecological processes when designing prescribed flow regimes.},

abstract = {In high-altitude alpine catchments, diurnal streamflow cycles are typically dominated by snowmelt or ice melt. Evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycles are less observed in these catchments but might happen simultaneously. During a field campaign in the summer 2012 in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20.4 km2, glaciarized area: 2{\%}), we observed a transition in the early season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycle in one of two monitored subbasins. The two different cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within a time span of several days. In the second monitored subbasin, we observed an ice meltdominated diurnal cycle during the entire season due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between ice melt and evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening at the same times of day but with a different sign and a different shape. The amplitude of the ice melt cycle decreased exponentially during the season and was larger than the amplitude of the evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the season. Our study suggests that an evapotranspirationdominated diurnal streamflow cycle could damp the ice melt-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle. The two types of diurnal streamflow cycles were separated using a method based on the identification of the active riparian area and measurement of evapotranspiration.},

abstract = {In most cases, intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) form the principal surface water bodies in Mediterranean regions and people are heavily dependent on them. Strong reliance on such streams results in numerous pressures, and complex relationships are formed between their various natural and anthropogenic components, which creates numerous challenges to decision-makers who require a better understanding of IRES to establish effective measures to restore ecosystem functionality and implement changes, while maintaining human well-being. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework that identifies process cascades and links to identify the variables governing Mediterranean IRES and map their complex interrelations. Climate is the main external driver, and it affects IRES through precipitation, temperature, wind action, and geomorphic factors, which in turn influence the physical and biological attributes of IRES. Monitoring challenges and knowledge gaps are presented from the conceptual framework, highlighting the need to identify solutions for the monitoring and mapping the spatio-temporal variability of flow regimes and their influence on bio-physical variables and mapping and quantifying ecosystem services for integrated environmental management. Finally, we argue that remote sensing techniques, specifically, the combined use of unmanned aerial vehicles and structure from motion photogrammetry, are key to bridging gaps in understanding and meeting the challenges of managing Mediterranean IRES.},

@article{Rosenfeld2003,
abstract = {With the widespread decline and endangerment of freshwater fishes, there is a need to clearly define habitat requirements for effective species management and habitat restoration. Fish biologists often infer habitat requirements on the basis of correlative habitat associations in the wild. This generates descriptive models that predict species presence or abundance at a hierarchy of scales: distributional (macrohabitat) models predict the presence/absence of species at large scales, capacity models predict the abundance at the reach or channel unit scale when a species is present, and microhabitat models predict the distribution of individual fish at smaller spatial scales (e.g., instream habitat suitability curves for velocity, depth, and substrate). However, relationships based on habitat associations in the wild rarely give definitive insight into the absolute requirement for a particular habitat (i.e., necessity of a habitat for the persistence of individuals and populations). The assumption that habitat selection accurately reflects the fitness consequences of habitat use is rarely validated; more rigorous assessment of habitat requirement usually involves manipulative experiments or measurements of fitness (individual growth, survival, or reproductive success) in different habitat types. Bioenergetic habitat models offer a promising mechanistic alternative to correlative habitat suitability models for drift-feeding fish and have the potential to predict habitat-specific growth rates on the basis of swimming costs and energy intake. Once smaller-scale habitat requirements of individuals are well defined, the final step is to determine when and how the requirements of individuals limit populations. Extrapolating smaller-scale habitat requirements to the population level requires either large-scale (ecosystem) manipulations of habitat, adaptive management, or habitat-explicit population models. For species with distinct ontogenic shifts in habitat requirements, the concept of optimal habitat ratios may be useful for identifying limiting habitat factors and defining baselines for habitat restoration. Defining optimal habitat configurations for different species may also provide a basis for predicting how habitat change differentially affects species with contrasting habitat needs.},

We frame the sensitivity analysis questions in terms of the main purposes of sensitivity analysis: parameter prioritization, trend identification, and interaction quantification. For parameter prioritization, we consider variance-based sensitivity measures, sensitivity indices based on the L1-norm, the Kuiper metric, and the sensitivity indices of the DELSA methods. For trend identification, we investigate insights derived from graphing the one-way ANOVA sensitivity functions, the recently introduced CUSUNORO plots, and derivative scatterplots. For interaction quantification, we consider information delivered by variance-based sensitivity indices. We rely on the so-called given-data principle, in which results from a set of model runs are used to perform a defined set of analyses. One avoids using specific designs for each insight, thus controlling the computational burden. The methodology is applied to a hydrological model of a river in Belgium simulated using the well-established Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) on five alternative configurations. The findings show that the integration of the chosen methods provides insights unavailable in most other analyses.},

abstract = {Water allocation institutions globally must operate within legal and political contexts established by precedent and codified in operating rules, even as they flex and adjust to climate change. California's Central Valley Water System (CVS) is a prime example. Recent global, national, regional, and local climate change assessments have highlighted climate-change-driven impacts on the CVS; however, these previous studies have not discussed the relative likelihood of performance decline, making it difficult to use the information for planning. In response, this paper presents a systematic climate change stress test that utilizes a physically based hydrologic model linked with a water resources system model representing the infrastructure, operations, and policy constraints of the interconnected system of natural river channels and man-made facilities that comprise the CVS. The results provide a summary of the sensitivity of the system to climate change, indicating the specific climate changes that cause performance of the system to decline below historical norms, and an estimation of the General Circulation Model (GCM) informed probability of those changes by 2050. Degraded performance is especially likely for State Water Project (SWP) deliveries ({\textgreater} 85{\%}), and September carryover/drought storage in the Oroville Reservoir (the SWP's largest reservoir, {\~{}} 95{\%} likely to degrade).

abstract = {Drought has been called a creeping disaster because of the way it$\backslash$ndevelops slowly. It can be defined according to meteorological,$\backslash$nhydrological and agriculture criteria. Agricultural drought occurs when$\backslash$nthe rainfall and soil moisture are inadequate to meet the water$\backslash$nrequirements of crops. It is typically evident after meteorological$\backslash$ndrought but before a hydrological drought. In 2005, several news has$\backslash$nreported severity of drought in Thailand, especially in north eastern$\backslash$npart; however, there is still no well developed early warning system for$\backslash$ndrought in Indo-China areas. It is therefore necessary to develop an$\backslash$napproach to identify agricultural drought area for early drought warning$\backslash$nsystem. The aim of this study is to detect the agricultural drought area$\backslash$nand intensity in paddy fields. Burirum Province affected by drought$\backslash$nrecently is selected as study area. Firstly, temporal NDVIs (Normalized$\backslash$nDifference Vegetation Index) in paddy fields are calculated from MOD09$\backslash$nproduct. Then two approaches are adopted to process temporal NDVIs$\backslash$nnamely Local Maximum fitting (LMF) filtering and scale-space filtering$\backslash$nrespectively. LMF filtering can extract the similar trend of the$\backslash$ntemporal NDVIs through years, so it is used to create robust NDVI; on$\backslash$nthe other hand, scale space filtering can well illustrate the change of$\backslash$nNDVI value in each year, such as drops affected by drought, so it is$\backslash$nadopted to create sensitive NDVI. Finally, NDVI difference between$\backslash$nrobust and sensitive NDVI is calculated and the drought risk map in$\backslash$nstudy area is created based on the various ranges of derived NDVI$\backslash$ndifference. The final results show that this NDVI approach is reasonable$\backslash$nand useful to detect the agriculture drought areas and intensity on$\backslash$nagriculture according to field survey result. In the future,$\backslash$nagricultural drought will be estimated in terms of water budget$\backslash$ncombining RS and meteorological data and compared to NDVI-based approach$\backslash$nfor developing early drought warning system.},

abstract = {This paper describes calibration methods for models of agricultural production and water use in which economic variables can directly interact with hydrologic network models or other biophysical system models. We also describe and demonstrate the use of systematic calibration checks at different stages for efficient debugging of models. The central model is the California Statewide Agricultural Production Model (SWAP), a Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) model of California irrigated agriculture. We outline the six step calibration procedure and demonstrate the model with an empirical policy analysis. Two new techniques are included compared with most previous PMP-based models: exponential PMP cost functions and Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) regional production functions. We then demonstrate the use of this type of disaggregated production model for policy analysis by evaluating potential water transfers under drought conditions. The analysis links regional production functions with a water supply network. The results show that a more flexible water market allocation can reduce revenue losses from drought up to 30{\%}. These results highlight the potential of self-calibrated models in policy analysis. While the empirical application is for a California agricultural and environmental water system, the approach is general and applicable to many other situations and locations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We investigated mechanisms of stream flow generation, water flowpaths and the degree of meltwater-soil interactions during snowmelt events in a high-elevation forested catchment of the Adirondack Mountains, New York. We sampled runoff and measured the discharge of a first-order stream draining a 30-ha subalpine forested watershed on the northwest slope of Whiteface Mountain, New York during melting of the seasonal snowpack. Chemical and Sr isotope tracer measurements were combined to assess the relative contributions of direct runoff of meltwater, soil water and ground water to streamflow generated by snowmelt events. The Esther Brook Watershed responded rapidly to springtime energy inputs and increased stream water discharge occurred within 5 to 55 h of the onset of rain or above-freezing air temperatures. Meltwater discharges were accompanied by pronounced Ph depressions and substantial elemental exports. The important sources of ions in runoff shifted from the snowpack ion load, to organic soil horizon labile reservoirs to elemental release from mineral soil and glacial till sources as the melt season progressed and the flow system deepened. The Sr isotope tracer system gave results that were generally consistent with the interpretations based on Si and DOC as tracers of water flowpaths. Assessing the relative contribution of different ecosystem reservoirs to the elements released during snowmelt is important to improved understanding of ecosystem element dynamics.},

abstract = {In spite of the importance of stream network dynamics for hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry, there is limited availability of analytical tools suitable for characterizing the temporal variability of the active fraction of river networks. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of Stream Length Duration Curve (SLDC), the inverse of the exceedance probability of the total length of active streams. SLDCs summarize efficiently the effect of hydrological variability on the length of the flowing streams under a variety of settings. A set of stochastic network models is developed to link the features of the local hydrological status of the network nodes with the shape of the SLDC. We show that the mean network length is dictated by the mean persistency of the nodes, whereas the shape of the SLDC is driven by the spatial distribution of the local persistencies and their network-scale spatial correlation. Ten field surveys performed in 2018 were used to estimate the empirical SLDC of the Valfredda river (Italy), which was found to be steep and regular—indicating a pronounced sensitivity of the active stream length to the underlying hydrological conditions. Available observations also suggest that the activation of temporary reaches during network expansion is hierarchical, from the most to the least persistent stretches. Under these circumstances, the SLDC corresponds to the spatial Cumulative Distribution Function of the nodes persistencies. The study provides a sound theoretical basis for the analyses of network dynamics in temporary rivers.},

abstract = {Understanding factors influencing survival of Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) is essential to species conservation, because drivers of mortality can vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Although recent studies have evaluated the effects of climate, habitat quality, or resource management (e.g., hatchery operations) on salmonid recruitment and survival, a failure to look at multiple factors simultaneously leaves open questions about the relative importance of different factors. We analyzed the relationship between ten factors and survival (1980-2007) of four populations of salmonids with distinct life histories from two adjacent watersheds (Salmon and Scott rivers) in the Klamath River basin, California. The factors were ocean abundance, ocean harvest, hatchery releases, hatchery returns, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation, snow depth, flow, and watershed disturbance. Permutation tests and linear mixed-effects models tested effects of factors on survival of each taxon. Potential factors affecting survival differed among taxa and between locations. Fall Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha survival trends appeared to be driven partially or entirely by hatchery practices. Trends in three taxa (Salmon River spring Chinook salmon, Scott River fall Chinook salmon; Salmon River summer steelhead trout O. mykiss) were also likely driven by factors subject to climatic forcing (ocean abundance, summer flow). Our findings underscore the importance of multiple factors in simultaneously driving population trends in widespread species such as anadromous salmonids. They also show that the suite of factors may differ among different taxa in the same location as well as among populations of the same taxa in different watersheds. In the Klamath basin, hatchery practices need to be reevaluated to protect wild salmonids. {\textcopyright} 2014 Quinones et al.},

abstract = {Changes in precipitation extremes under greenhouse warming are commonly assumed to be constrained by changes in the amounts of precipitable water in the atmosphere. Global climate models generally predict only marginal changes in relative humidity, implying that the actual amount of atmospheric precipitable water scales with the water vapour content of saturation, which is governed by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. Indeed, changes in daily precipitation extremes in global climate models seem to be consistent with the 7{\%} increase per degree of warming given by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, but it is uncertain how general this scaling behaviour is across timescales. Here, we analyse a 99-year record of hourly precipitation observations from De Bilt, the Netherlands, and find that one-hour precipitation extremes increase twice as fast with rising temperatures as expected from the Clausius–Clapeyron relation when daily mean temperatures exceed 12 °C. In addition, simulations with a high-resolution regional climate model show that one-hour precipitation extremes increase at a rate close to 14{\%} per degree of warming in large parts of Europe. Our results demonstrate that changes in short-duration precipitation extremes may well exceed expectations from the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. These short-duration extreme events can have significant impacts, such as local flooding, erosion and water damage.},

abstract = {The two-layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC-2L) model is extended to incorporate a representation of subgrid variability in precipitation, using an analytical one- dimensional statistical dynamic representation for partial area coverage of precipitation. The analytical approach allows the effects of subgrid-scale spatial variability of precipitation on surface fluxes, runoff production, and soil moisture to be represented explicitly. With this method, spatially integrated representations of surface fluxes, runoff, and soil moisture due to subgrid-scale spatial variability in precipitation, infiltration, and vegetation cover are obtained. The results are compared with those obtained using an exhaustive pixel-based approach, and the results obtained by applying uniform precipitation over the precipitation- covered area. The precipitation coverage over a grid cell is shown to play a primary role in estimating the surface fluxes, runoff, and soil moisture. In general, the spatial distribution of precipitation within the precipitation-covered area plays a secondary role, in part because VIC-2L represents the subgrid spatial variability of soil properties. While the analytical approach gives good approximations to the pixel-based approach, and is superior to the uniform precipitation approach in general, the differences are not large. 1.},

abstract = {Future global warming is widely anticipated to increase the occurrence of extreme precipitation events, but such hydrological changes have received limited attention within paleoclimate studies. Several proxy have recently invoked changes in the occurrence of extreme precipitation events to explain observations, studies of the hydrological response to the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum hyperthermal, ∼56 Ma, but these changes have not been studied for the geologic past using climate models. Here, we use a coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model, HadCM3L, to study regional changes in metrics for extreme precipitation across the onset of the PETM by comparing simulations performed with possible PETM and pre-PETM greenhouse gas forcings. Our simulations show a shift in the frequency–intensity relationship of precipitation, with extreme events increasing in importance over tropical regions including equatorial Africa and southern America. The incidence of some extreme events increases by up to 70{\%} across the PETM in some regions. While the most extreme precipitation rates tend to relate to increases in convective precipitation, in some regions dynamic changes in atmospheric circulation are also of importance. Although shortcomings in the ability of general circulation models to represent the daily cycle of precipitation and the full range of extreme events precludes a direct comparison of absolute precipitation rates, our simulations provide a useful spatial framework for interpreting hydrological proxies from this time period. Our results indicate that changes in extreme precipitation behaviour may be decoupled from those in mean annual precipitation, including, for example in east Africa, where the change in mean annual precipitation is small but a large increase in the size and frequency of extreme events occurs. This has important implications for the interpretation of the hydrological proxy record and our understanding of climatic, as well as biogeochemical, responses to global warming events.},

abstract = {Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is typically used to enhance the agricultural water supply but may also be promising to maintain summer streamflows and temperatures for cold-water fish. An existing aquifer model, water temperature data, and analysis of water administration were used to assess potential benefits of MAR to cold-water fisheries in Idaho's Snake River. This highly-regulated river supports irrigated agriculture worth US {\$}10 billion and recreational trout fisheries worth {\$}100 million. The assessment focused on the Henry's Fork Snake River, which receives groundwater from recharge incidental to irrigation and from MAR operations 8 km from the river, addressing (1) the quantity and timing of MAR-produced streamflow response, (2) the mechanism through which MAR increases streamflow, (3) whether groundwater inputs decrease the local stream temperature, and (4) the legal and administrative hurdles to using MAR for cold-water fisheries conservation in Idaho. The model estimated a long-term 4{\%}-7{\%} increase in summertime streamflow from annual MAR similar to that conducted in 2019. Water temperature observations confirmed that recharge increased streamflow via aquifer discharge rather than reduction in river losses to the aquifer. In addition, groundwater seeps created summer thermal refugia. Measured summer stream temperature at seeps was within the optimal temperature range for brown trout, averaging 14.4 °C, whereas ambient stream temperature exceeded 19 °C, the stress threshold for brown trout. Implementing MAR for fisheries conservation is challenged by administrative water rules and regulations. Well-developed and trusted water rights and water-transaction systems in Idaho and other western states enable MAR. However, in Idaho, conservation groups are unable to engage directly in water transactions, hampering MAR for fisheries protection.},

annote = {social sciences need better spatial autocorrelation methods in their exploratory statistics

Autocorrelated residuals
"Common in standard regression analyses of dependent variables that are themselves autocorrelated"

Mechanisms that can cause spatial autocorrelation
-Feedback. Neighbors influence each other.
-Grouping forces, like local housing or labor markets. (When such a variable is responsible for spatial autocorrelation it may be possible to identify the variable(s) involved and operationalize them)
-Grouping responses (individuals responding the same way to forces)
- nuisance autocorrelation, distinct from "substantive" or mechanism-based autocorrelation. most common: undelying spatial process creates regions of attribute clustering that are much larger than the units of observation chosen/available to the analyst. Makes spatial autocorrelation inevitable.

Why do autocorrelated residuals cause problems? violates the independence assumption. Makes statistical inference unreliable because 1) estimated regression parameters are biased and inconisstent, or 2) standard errors of the parameter estmitaes are baised. 
Basically, positively autocorrelated residuals may lead to standard errors that are too small, which could mean you claim statistical significance when it is unwarranted. 

How do we deal with autocorrelation?
1) consider removing large-scale drift / spatial dependence. A pre-analysis step because spatial regression assumes a stationary spatial process.
2) fit standard OLS model
3) with a theory about why autocorrelation is present, and using OLS diagnostics, fit a spatial regression model. 
4) Maybe repeat from step 1. 

Reanalysis:
1) test dependent variable for normality. Test the bivariate relationship of each indep var with the dep var for linearity.
2) Moran scatterplot (identify and possibly exclude outliers) and "local" Moran's I map
3) spatial error model. Wu = "Wu is a n {\textperiodcentered}1 vector of spatial lags of the model disturbance term u"??

Explaining spatial autocorrelation: portions may be "explained" bay independent variables (which are autocorrelated). Remainder assued to occur because of spatial autocorrelation among disturbance terms, which happens because one or more relevant autocorr. variable is omitted from the design matrix.

spatial lag model... does not perform as well as the spatial error model. Much of the variation appears unaccounted for/summarized in the error term


Linear regression assumption:
Residuals are not correlated. Violated if they're autocorrelated.},

@article{Richter1997a,
abstract = {1. This paper introduces a new approach for setting streamflow-based river ecosystem management targets and this method is called the 'Range of Variability Approach' (RVA). The proposed approach derives from aquatic ecology theory concerning the critical role of hydrological variability, and associated characteristics of timing, frequency, duration, and rates of change, in sustaining aquatic ecosystems. The method is intended for application on rivers wherein the conservation of native aquatic biodiversity and protection of natural ecosystem functions are primary river management objectives. 2. The RVA uses as its starting point either measured or synthesized daily streamflow values from a period during which human perturbations to the hydrological regime were negligible. This streamflow record is then characterized using thirty-two different hydrological parameters, using methods defined in Richter et al. (1996). Using the RVA, a range of variation in each of the thirty-two parameters, e.g. the values at ± 1 standard deviation from the mean or the twenty-fifth to seventy-fifth percentile range, are selected as initial flow management targets. 3. The RVA targets are intended to guide the design of river management strategies (e.g. reservoir operations rules, catchment restoration) that will lead to attainment of these targets on an annual basis. The RVA will enable river managers to define and adopt readily interim management targets before conclusive, long-term ecosystem research results are available. The RVA targets and management strategies should be adaptively refined as suggested by research results and as needed to sustain native aquatic ecosystem biodiversity and integrity.},

abstract = {We developed stochastic matrix models to evaluate the effects of hydrologic alteration and variable mortality on the population dynamics of a lotie fish in a regulated river system. Models were applied to a representative lotic fish species, the flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), for which two populations were examined: a native population from a regulated reach of the Coosa River (Alabama, USA) and an introduced population from an unregulated section of the Ocmulgee River (Georgia, USA). Size-classified matrix models were constructed for both populations, and residuals from catch-curve regressions were used as indices of year class strength (i.e., recruitment). A multiple regression model indicated that recruitment of flathead catfish in the Coosa River was positively related to the frequency of spring pulses between 283 and 566 m3/s. For the Ocmulgee River population, multiple regression models indicated that year class strength was negatively related to mean March discharge and positively related to June low flow. When the Coosa population was modeled to experience five consecutive years of favorable hydrologic conditions during a 50-year projection period, it exhibited a substantial spike in size and increased at an overall 0.2{\%} annual rate. When modeled to experience five years of unfavorable hydrologic conditions, the Coosa population initially exhibited a decrease in size but later stabilized and increased at a 0.4{\%} annual rate following the decline. When the Ocmulgee River population was modeled to experience five years of favorable conditions, it exhibited a substantial spike in size and increased at an overall 0.4{\%} annual rate. After the Ocmulgee population experienced five years of unfavorable conditions, a sharp decline in population size was predicted. However, the population quickly recovered, with population size increasing at a 0.3{\%} annual rate following the decline. In general, stochastic population growth in the Ocmulgee River was more erratic and variable than population growth in the Coosa River. We encourage ecologists to develop similar models for other lotic species, particularly in regulated river systems. Successful management of fish populations in regulated systems requires that we are able to predict how hydrology affects recruitment and will ultimately influence the population dynamics of fishes. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {This report documents a Newton formulation of MODFLOW-2005, called MODFLOW-NWT. MODFLOW- NWT is a standalone program that is intended for solving problems involving drying and rewetting nonlinearities of the unconfined groundwater-flow equation. MODFLOW- NWT must be used with the Upstream-Weighting (UPW) Package for calculating intercell conductances in a different manner than is done in the Block-Centered Flow (BCF), Layer Property Flow (LPF), or Hydrogeologic-Unit Flow (HUF; Anderman and Hill, 2000) Packages. TheUPW Package treats nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting by use of a continuous function of groundwater head, rather than the discrete approach of drying and rewetting that is used by the BCF, LPF, and HUF Packages. This further enables application of the Newton formulation for unconfined groundwater-flow problems because conductance derivatives required by the Newton method are smooth over the full range of head for a model cell. The NWT linearization approach generates an asymmetric matrix, which is different from the standard MODFLOW formulation that generates a symmetric matrix. Because all linear solvers presently available for use with MODFLOW-2005 solve only symmetric matrices, MODFLOW-NWT includes two previously developed asymmetric matrix-solver options. The matrix-solver options include a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES) Solver and an Orthomin / stabilized conjugate-gradient (CGSTAB) Solver. The GMRES Solver is documented in a previously published report, such that only a brief description and input instructions are provided in this report. However, the CGSTAB Solver (called $\chi$MD) is documented in this report. Flow-property input for the UPW Package is designed based on the LPF Package and material-property input is identical to that for the LPF Package except that the rewetting and vertical-conductance correction options of the LPF Package are not available with the UPW Package. Input files constructed for the LPF Package can be used with slight modification as input for the UPW Package. This report presents the theory and methods used by MODFLOW-NWT,including the UPW Package. Additionally, this report provides comparisons of the new methodology to analytical solutions of groundwater flow and to standard MODFLOW-2005 results by use of an unconfined aquifer MODFLOW example problem. The standard MODFLOW-2005 simulation uses the LPF Package with the wet/dry option active. A new example problem also is presented to demonstrate MODFLOW- NWT's ability to provide a solution for a difficult unconfined groundwater-flow problem.},

Exhaled breath condensate is a noninvasive means of sampling the airways, allowing biomarkers of airway inflammation and oxidative stress to be measured. In the present review, the use of exhaled breath condensate biomarkers in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is explored and potential applications in diagnosis, disease phenotyping, exacerbation monitoring and clinical trials are considered. Exhaled breath condensate biomarkers are comprehensively reviewed in terms of method validation, reproducibility, disease specificity and sensitivity to detect changes in airway inflammation. The commonly used exhaled breath condensate methodologies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients are shown to have considerable variability, due to technical issues concerning both sample collection and analysis. Despite these issues, there is still data to support the use of exhaled breath condensate biomarkers for monitoring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and the response to pharmacological intervention. Further improvements to sample collection and analysis methods will improve the sensitivity of these biomarkers. The use of cytokine arrays, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance profiling of exhaled breath condensate has opened a new avenue for analysis, as hypothesis generation from such profiling may lead to further selection of biomarkers for specific analysis.},

This article explores the use of the robust control framework toward this end. After briefly outlining the robust control framework, we apply it to the traditional Gordon-Schaefer fishery model to explore fundamental performance-robustness and robustness-vulnerability trade-offs in natural resource management. We find that the classic optimal control policy can be very sensitive to parametric uncertainty. By exploring a large class of alternative strategies, we show that there are no panaceas: even mild robustness properties are difficult to achieve, and increasing robustness to some parameters (e.g., biological parameters) results in decreased robustness with respect to others (e.g., economic parameters). On the basis of this example, we extract some broader themes for better management of resources under uncertainty and for sustainability science in general. Specifically, we focus attention on the importance of a continual learning process and the use of robust control to inform this process. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Most field-based approaches that address runoff generation questions have been conducted in steep landscapes with shallow soils. Runoff generation processes in low relief landscapes with deep soils remain less understood. We addressed this by characterizing dominant runoff generating flow paths by monitoring the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, shallow soil moisture, and shallow and deep groundwater dynamics in a 3.3 ha ephemeral-to-intermittent drainage network in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, USA. This Piedmont region is gently sloped with highly weathered soils characterized by shallow impeding layers due to decreases in saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth. Our results indicated two dominant catchment storage states driven by seasonal evapotranspiration. Within these states, distinct flow paths were activated, resulting in divergent hydrograph recessions. Groundwater dynamics during precipitation events with different input characteristics and contrasting storage states showed distinct shallow and deep groundwater flow path behavior could produce similar runoff magnitudes. During an event with low antecedent storage, activation of a shallow, perched, transient water table dominated runoff production. During an event with high antecedent storage, the deeper water table activated shallow flow paths by rising into the shallow transmissive soil horizons. Despite these differing processes, the relationship between active surface drainage length (ASDL) and runoff was consistent. Hysteretic behavior between ASDL and runoff suggested that while seasonal ASDLs can be predicted based on runoff, the mechanisms and source areas producing flow can be highly variable and not easily estimated from runoff alone. These processes and flow paths have significant implications for stream chemistry across seasons and storage states.},
