Recon. Day,River Reconnection Day,"The day, usually in the fall, on which the Scott River gains a certain degree of connectivity. Defined as the first day on which FJ Gauge flow rises above a designated threshold (e.g., 10 or 100 cfs) (units of days after Aug. 31)."
Discon. Day,River Disconnection Day,"The day, usually in the spring or early summer, on which the Scott River loses a certain degree of connectivity. Defined as the first day on which FJ Gauge flow drops below a designated threshold (e.g., 10 or 100 cfs) (units of days after Aug. 31)."
Min. Flow,Minimum Flow,Minimum average daily flowrate recorded in the relevant period.
CFLP,Coho Freshwater Life Period,"The (conservatively wide) 21-month window, September through July, in which members of a cohort or the cohort's spawning parents are present in the freshwater system."
